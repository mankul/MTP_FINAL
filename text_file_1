Based on lectures the Swami delivered in his rented rooms at 228 W
39th Street in December, 1895 and January, 1896. The classes were
free of charge. Generally the Swami held two classes daily- morning
and evening.
Although the Swami delivered many lectures and held numerous classes
in the two years and five months he had been in America, these lectures
constituted a departure in the way they were recorded. Just prior to the
commencement of his Winter -95-96 season in NYC, his friends and
supporters aided him by advertising for and ultimately hiring a
professional stenographer: The man selected, Joseph Josiah Goodwin,
later became a disciple of the Swami and followed him to England and
India.
