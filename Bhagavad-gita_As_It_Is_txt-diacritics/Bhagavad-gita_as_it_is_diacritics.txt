Foreword
The Bhagavad-gétä is the best known and the most frequently translated of Vedic
religious texts. Why it should be so appealing to the Western mind is an
interesting question. It has drama, for its setting is a scene of two great
armies, banners flying, drawn up opposite one another on the field, poised for
battle. It has ambiguity, and the fact that Arjuna and his charioteer Kåñëa are
carrying on their dialogue between the two armies suggests the indecision of
Arjuna about the basic question: should he enter battle against and kill those
who are friends and kinsmen? It has mystery, as Kåñëa demonstrates to Arjuna His
cosmic form. It has a properly complicated view of the ways of the religious
life and treats of the paths of knowledge, works, discipline and faith and their
inter-relationships, problems that have bothered adherents of other religions in
other times and places. The devotion spoken of is a deliberate means of
religious satisfaction, not a mere outpouring of poetic emotion. Next to the
Bhägavata-puräëa, a long work from South India, the Gétä is the text most
frequently quoted in the philosophical writings of the Gauòéya Vaiñëava school,
the school represented by Swami Bhaktivedanta as the latest in a long succession
of teachers. It can be said that this school of Vaiñëavism was founded, or
revived, by Çré Kåñëa-Caitanya Mahäprabhu (1486-1533) in Bengal, and that it is
currently the strongest single religious force in the eastern part of the Indian
subcontinent. The Gauòiya Vaiñëava school, for whom Kåñëa is Himself the Supreme
God, and not merely an incarnation of another deity, sees bhakti as an immediate
and powerful religious force, consisting of love between man and God. Its
discipline consists of devoting all one’s actions to the Deity, and one listens
to the stories of Kåñëa from the sacred texts, one chants Kåñëa’s name, washes,
bathes, and dresses the mürti of Kåñëa, feeds Him and takes the remains of the
food offered to Him, thus absorbing His grace; one does these things and many
more, until one has been changed: the devotee has become transformed into one
close to Kåñëa, and sees the Lord face to face.

Swami Bhaktivedanta comments upon the Gétä from this point of view, and that is
legitimate. More than that, in this translation the Western reader has the
unique opportunity of seeing how a Kåñëa devotee interprets his own texts. It is
the Vedic exegetical tradition, justly famous, in action. This book is then a
welcome addition from many points of view. It can serve as a valuable textbook
for the college student. It allows us to listen to a skilled interpreter
explicating a text which has profound religious meaning. It gives us insights
into the original and highly convincing ideas of the Gauòiya Vaiñëava school. In
providing the Sanskrit in both Devanagari and transliteration, it offers the
Sanskrit specialist the opportunity to re-interpret, or debate particular
Sanskrit meanings—although I think there will be little disagreement about the
quality of the Swami’s Sanskrit scholarship. And finally, for the nonspecialist,
there is readable English and a devotional attitude which cannot help but move
the sensitive reader. And there are the paintings, which, incredibly as it may
seem to those familiar with contemporary Indian religious art, were done by
American devotees.

The scholar, the student of Gauòéya Vaiñëavism, and the increasing number of
Western readers interested in classical Vedic thought have been done a service
by Swami Bhaktivedanta. By bringing us a new and living interpretation of a text
already known to many, he has increased our understanding manyfold; and
arguments for understanding, in these days of estrangement, need not be made.

Preface
Originally I wrote Bhagavad-gétä As It Is in the form in which it is presented
now. When this book was first published, the original manuscript was,
unfortunately, cut short to less than 400 pages, without illustrations and
without explanations for most of the original verses of the Çrémad
Bhagavad-gétä. In all of my other books—Çrémad Bhägavatam, Çré Éçopaniñad,
etc.—the system is that I give the original verse, its English transliteration,
word-for-word Sanskrit-English equivalents, translations and purports. This
makes the book very authentic and scholarly and makes the meaning self-evident.
I was not very happy, therefore, when I had to minimize my original manuscript.
But later on, when the demand for Bhagavad-gétä As It Is considerably increased,
I was requested by many scholars and devotees to present the book in its
original form, and Messrs. Macmillan and Co. agreed to publish the complete
edition. Thus the present attempt is to offer the original manuscript of this
great book of knowledge with full paramparä explanation in order to establish
the Kåñëa consciousness movement more soundly and progressively.

Our Kåñëa consciousness movement is genuine, historically authorized, natural
and transcendental due to its being based on Bhagavad-gétä As It Is. It is
gradually becoming the most popular movement in the entire world, especially
amongst the younger generation. It is becoming more and more interesting to the
older generation also. Older gentlemen are becoming interested, so much so that
the fathers and grandfathers of my disciples are encouraging us by becoming life
members of our great society, the International Society for Krishna
Consciousness. In Los Angeles many fathers and mothers used to come to see me to
express their feelings of gratitude for my leading the Kåñëa consciousness
movement throughout the entire world. Some of them said that it is greatly
fortunate for the Americans that I have started the Kåñëa consciousness movement
in America. But actually the original father of this movement is Lord Kåñëa
Himself, since it was started a very long time ago but is coming down to human
society by disciplic succession. If I have any credit in this connection, it
does not belong to me personally, but it is due to my eternal spiritual master,
His Divine Grace Om Viñëupäda Paramahaàsa Parivräjakäcärya 108 Çré Çrémad
Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Gosvämé Mahäräja Prabhupäda.

If personally I have any credit in this matter, it is only that I have tried to
present Bhagavad-gétä as it is, without adulteration. Before my presentation of
Bhagavad-gétä As It Is, almost all the English editions of Bhagavad-gétä were
introduced to fulfill someone’s personal ambition. But our attempt, in
presenting Bhagavad-gétä As It Is, is to present the mission of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa. Our business is to present the will of Kåñëa, not
that of any mundane speculator like the politician, philosopher or scientist,
for they have very little knowledge of Kåñëa, despite all their other knowledge.
When Kåñëa says, man-manä bhava mad-bhakto mad-yäjé mäà namaskuru, etc., we,
unlike the so-called scholars, do not say that Kåñëa and His inner spirit are
different. Kåñëa is absolute, and there is no difference between Kåñëa’s name,
Kåñëa’s form, Kåñëa’s quality, Kåñëa’s pastimes, etc. This absolute position of
Kåñëa is difflcult to understand for any person who is not a devotee of Kåñëa in
the paramparä (disciplic succession) system. Generally the so-called scholars,
politicians, philosophers, and svämés, without perfect knowledge of Kåñëa, try
to banish or kill Kåñëa when writing commentary on Bhagavad-gétä. Such
unauthorized commentary upon Bhagavad-gétä is known as Mäyävädé-Bhäñya, and Lord
Caitanya has warned us about these unauthorized men. Lord Caitanya clearly says
that anyone who tries to understand Bhagavad-gétä from the Mäyävädé point of
view will commit a great blunder. The result of such a blunder will be that the
misguided student of Bhagavad-gétä will certainly be bewildered on the path of
spiritual guidance and will not be able to go back home, back to Godhead.

Our only purpose is to present this Bhagavad-gétä As It Is in order to guide the
conditioned student to the same purpose for which Kåñëa descends to this planet
once in a day of Brahmä, or every 8,600,000,000 years. This purpose is stated in
Bhagavad-gétä, and we have to accept it as it is; otherwise there is no point in
trying to understand the Bhagavad-gétä and its speaker, Lord Kåñëa. Lord Kåñëa
first spoke Bhagavad-gétä to the sun-god some hundreds of millions of years ago.
We have to accept this fact and thus understand the historical significance of
Bhagavad-gétä, without misinterpretation, on the authority of Kåñëa. To
interpret Bhagavad-gétä without any reference to the will of Kåñëa is the
greatest offense. In order to save oneself from this offense, one has to
understand the Lord as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as He was directly
understood by Arjuna, Lord Kåñëa’s first disciple. Such understanding of
Bhagavad-gétä is really profitable and authorized for the welfare of human
society in fulfilling the mission of life.

The Kåñëa consciousness movement is essential in human society, for it offers
the highest perfection of life. How this is so is explained fully in the
Bhagavad-gétä. Unfortunately, mundane wranglers have taken advantage of
Bhagavad-gétä to push forward their demonic propensities and mislead people
regarding right understanding of the simple principles of life. Everyone should
know how God or Kåñëa is great, and everyone should know the factual position of
the living entities. Everyone should know that a living entity is eternally a
servant and that unless one serves Kåñëa one has to serve illusion in different
varieties of the three modes of material nature, and thus perpetually one has to
wander within the cycle of birth and death; even the so-called liberated
Mäyävädé speculator has to undergo this process. This knowledge constitutes a
great science, and each and every living being has to hear it for his own
interest.

People in general, especially in this age of Kali, are enamored by the external
energy of Kåñëa, and they wrongly think that by advancement of material comforts
every man will be happy. They have no knowledge that the material or external
nature is very strong, for everyone is strongly bound by the stringent laws of
material nature. A living entity is happily the part and parcel of the Lord, and
thus his natural function is to render immediate service to the Lord. By the
spell of illusion one tries to be happy by serving his personal sense
gratification in different forms which will never make him happy. Instead of
satisfying his own personal material senses, he has to satisfy the senses of the
Lord. That is the highest perfection of life. The Lord wants this, and He
demands it. One has to understand this central point of Bhagavad-gétä. Our Kåñëa
consciousness movement is teaching the whole world this central point, and
because we are not polluting the theme of Bhagavad-gétä As It Is, anyone
seriously interested in deriving benefit by studying the Bhagavad-gétä must take
help from the Kåñëa consciousness movement for practical understanding of
Bhagavad-gétä under the direct guidance of the Lord. We hope, therefore, that
people will derive the greatest benefit by studying Bhagavad-gétä As It Is as we
have presented it here, and if even one man becomes a pure devotee of the Lord
we shall consider our attempt a success.

Bhagavad-gétä is also known as Gétopaniñad. It is the essence of Vedic knowledge
and one of the most important Upaniñads in Vedic literature. Of course there are
many commentaries in English on the Bhagavad-gétä, and one may question the
necessity for another one. This present edition can be explained in the
following way. Recently an American lady asked me to recommend an English
translation of Bhagavad-gétä. Of course in America there are so many editions of
Bhagavad-gétä available in English, but as far as I have seen, not only in
America but also in India, none of them can be strictly said to be authoritative
because in almost every one of them the commentator has expressed his own
opinions without touching the spirit of Bhagavad-gétä as it is.

The spirit of Bhagavad-gétä is mentioned in Bhagavad-gétä itself. It is just
like this: if we want to take a particular medicine, then we have to follow the
directions written on the label. We cannot take the medicine according to our
own whim or the direction of a friend. It must be taken according to the
directions on the label or the directions given by a physician. Similarly,
Bhagavad-gétä should be taken or accepted as it is directed by the speaker
himself. The speaker of Bhagavad-gétä is Lord Çré Kåñëa. He is mentioned on
every page of Bhagavad-gétä as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Bhagavän. Of
course the word “bhagavän” sometimes refers to any powerful person or any
powerful demigod, and certainly here Bhagavän designates Lord Çré Kåñëa as a
great personality, but at the same time we should know that Lord Çré Kåñëa is
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as is confirmed by all great äcäryas
(spiritual masters) like Çaìkaräcärya, Rämänujäcärya, Madhväcärya, Nimbärka
Svämé, Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu and many other authorities of Vedic knowledge in
India. The Lord Himself also establishes Himself as the Supreme Personality of
Godhead in the Bhagavad-gétä, and He is accepted as such in the Brahma-saàhitä
and all the Puräëas, especially the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, known as the Bhägavata
Puräëa (Kåñëas tu bhagavän svayam). Therefore we should take Bhagavad-gétä as it
is directed by the Personality of Godhead Himself.

In the Fourth Chapter of the Gétä the Lord says:

(1) imaà vivasvate yogaà proktavän aham avyayam
vivasvän manave präha manur ikñväkave ’bravét

(2) evaà paramparä-präptam imaà räjarñayo viduù
sa käleneha mahatä yogo nañöaù parantapa

(3) sa eväyaà mayä te ’dya yogaù proktaù purätanaù
bhakto ’si me sakhä ceti rahasyaà hy etad uttamam

Here the Lord informs Arjuna that this system of yoga, the Bhagavad-gétä, was
first spoken to the sun-god, and the sun-god explained it to Manu, and Manu
explained it to Ikñväku, and in that way, by disciplic succession, one speaker
after another, this yoga system has been coming down. But in the course of time
it has become lost. Consequently the Lord has to speak it again, this time to
Arjuna on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra.

He tells Arjuna that He is relating this supreme secret to him because he is His
devotee and His friend. The purport of this is that Bhagavad-gétä is a treatise
which is especially meant for the devotee of the Lord. There are three classes
of transcendentalists, namely the jïäné, the yogé and the bhakta, or the
impersonalist, the meditator and the devotee. Here the Lord clearly tells Arjuna
that He is making him the first receiver of a new paramparä (disciplic
succession) because the old succession was broken. It was the Lord’s wish,
therefore, to establish another paramparä in the same line of thought that was
coming down from the sun-god to others, and it was His wish that His teaching be
distributed anew by Arjuna. He wanted Arjuna to become the authority in
understanding the Bhagavad-gétä. So we see that Bhagavad-gétä is instructed to
Arjuna especially because Arjuna was a devotee of the Lord, a direct student of
Kåñëa, and His intimate friend. Therefore Bhagavad-gétä is best understood by a
person who has qualities similar to Arjuna’s. That is to say he must be a
devotee in a direct relationship with the Lord. As soon as one becomes a devotee
of the Lord, he also has a direct relationship with the Lord. That is a very
elaborate subject matter, but briefly it can be stated that a devotee is in a
relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead in one of five different
ways:

1. One may be a devotee in a passive state;
2. One may be a devotee in an active state;
3. One may be a devotee as a friend;
4. One may be a devotee as a parent;
5. One may be a devotee as a conjugal lover.

Arjuna was in a relationship with the Lord as friend. Of course there is a gulf
of difference between this friendship and the friendship found in the material
world. This is transcendental friendship which cannot be had by everyone. Of
course everyone has a particular relationship with the Lord, and that
relationship is evoked by the perfection of devotional service. But in the
present status of our life, we have not only forgotten the Supreme Lord, but we
have forgotten our eternal relationship with the Lord. Every living being, out
of many, many billions and trillions of living beings, has a particular
relationship with the Lord eternally. That is called svarüpa. By the process of
devotional service, one can revive that svarüpa, and that stage is called
svarüpa-siddhi—perfection of one’s constitutional position. So Arjuna was a
devotee, and he was in touch with the Supreme Lord in friendship.

How Arjuna accepted this Bhagavad-gétä should be noted. His manner of acceptance
is given in the Tenth Chapter.

(12) arjuna uväca
paraà brahma paraà dhäma pavitraà paramaà bhavän
puruñaà çäçvataà divyam ädi-devam ajaà vibhum

(13) ähus tväm åñayaù sarve devarñir näradas tathä
asito devalo vyäsaù svayaà caiva bravéñi me

(14) sarvam etad åtaà manye yan mäà vadasi keçava
na hi te bhagavan vyaktià vidur devä na dänaväù

“Arjuna said: You are the Supreme Brahman, the ultimate, the supreme abode and
purifier, the Absolute Truth and the eternal Divine Person. You are the primal
God, transcendental and original, and You are the unborn and all-pervading
beauty. All the great sages like Närada, Asita, Devala, and Vyäsa proclaim this
of You, and now You Yourself are declaring it to me. O Kåñëa, I totally accept
as truth all that You have told me. Neither the gods nor demons, O Lord, know
Thy personality.” (Bg. 10. 12–14).

After hearing Bhagavad-gétä from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Arjuna
accepted Kåñëa as Paraà Brahma, the Supreme Brahman. Every living being is
Brahman, but the supreme living being, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is
the Supreme Brahman. Paraà dhäma means that He is the supreme rest or abode of
everything, pavitram means that He is pure, untainted by material contamination,
puruñam means that He is the supreme enjoyer, divyam, transcendental, ädi-devam,
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, ajam, the unborn, and vibhum, the greatest,
the all-pervading.

Now one may think that because Kåñëa was the friend of Arjuna, Arjuna was
telling Him all this by way of flattery, but Arjuna, just to drive out this kind
of doubt from the minds of the readers of Bhagavad-gétä, substantiates these
praises in the next verse when he says that Kåñëa is accepted as the Supreme
Personality of Godhead not only by himself but by authorities like the sage
Närada, Asita, Devala, Vyäsadeva and so on. These are great personalities who
distribute the Vedic knowledge as it is accepted by all äcäryas. Therefore
Arjuna tells Kåñëa that he accepts whatever He says to be completely perfect.
Sarvam etad åtaà manye: “I accept everything You say to be true.” Arjuna also
says that the personality of the Lord is very difficult to understand and that
He cannot be known even by the great demigods. This means that the Lord cannot
even be known by personalities greater than human beings. So how can a human
being understand Çré Kåñëa without becoming His devotee?

Therefore Bhagavad-gétä should be taken up in a spirit of devotion. One should
not think that he is equal to Kåñëa, nor should he think that Kåñëa is an
ordinary personality or even a very great personality. Lord Çré Kåñëa is the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, at least theoretically, according to the
statements of Bhagavad-gétä or the statements of Arjuna, the person who is
trying to understand the Bhagavad-gétä. We should therefore at least
theoretically accept Çré Kåñëa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and with
that submissive spirit we can understand the Bhagavad-gétä. Unless one reads the
Bhagavad-gétä in a submissive spirit, it is very difficult to understand
Bhagavad-gétä because it is a great mystery.

Just what is the Bhagavad-gétä? The purpose of Bhagavad-gétä is to deliver
mankind from the nescience of material existence. Every man is in difficulty in
so many ways, as Arjuna also was in difficulty in having to fight the Battle of
Kurukñetra. Arjuna surrendered unto Çré Kåñëa, and consequently this
Bhagavad-gétä was spoken. Not only Arjuna, but every one of us is full of
anxieties because of this material existence. Our very existence is in the
atmosphere of nonexistence. Actually we are not meant to be threatened by
nonexistence. Our existence is eternal. But somehow or other we are put into
asat. Asat refers to that which does not exist.

Out of so many human beings who are suffering, there are a few who are actually
inquiring about their position, as to what they are, why they are put into this
awkward position and so on. Unless one is awakened to this position of
questioning his suffering, unless he realizes that he doesn’t want suffering but
rather wants to make a solution to all sufferings, then one is not to be
considered a perfect human being. Humanity begins when this sort of inquiry is
awakened in one’s mind. In the Brahma-sütra this inquiry is called
“brahma-jijïäsä.” Every activity of the human being is to be considered a
failure unless he inquires about the nature of the Absolute. Therefore those who
begin to question why they are suffering or where they came from and where they
shall go after death are proper students for understanding Bhagavad-gétä. The
sincere student should also have a firm respect for the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. Such a student was Arjuna.

Lord Kåñëa descends specifically to reestablish the real purpose of life when
man forgets that purpose. Even then, out of many, many human beings who awaken,
there may be one who actually enters the spirit of understanding his position,
and for him this Bhagavad-gétä is spoken. Actually we are all followed by the
tiger of nescience, but the Lord is very merciful upon living entities,
especially human beings. To this end He spoke the Bhagavad-gétä, making His
friend Arjuna His student.

Being an associate of Lord Kåñëa, Arjuna was above all ignorance, but Arjuna was
put into ignorance on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra just to question Lord Kåñëa
about the problems of life so that the Lord could explain them for the benefit
of future generations of human beings and chalk out the plan of life. Then man
could act accordingly and perfect the mission of human life.

The subject of the Bhagavad-gétä entails the comprehension of five basic truths.
First of all, the science of God is explained and then the constitutional
position of the living entities, jévas. There is éçvara, which means controller,
and there are jévas, the living entities which are controlled. If a living
entity says that he is not controlled but that he is free, then he is insane.
The living being is controlled in every respect, at least in his conditioned
life. So in the Bhagavad-gétä the subject matter deals with the éçvara, the
supreme controller, and the jévas, the controlled living entities. Prakåti
(material nature) and time (the duration of existence of the whole universe or
the manifestation of material nature) and karma (activity) are also discussed.
The cosmic manifestation is full of different activities. All living entities
are engaged in different activities. From Bhagavad-gétä we must learn what God
is, what the living entities are, what prakrti is, what the cosmic manifestation
is and how it is controlled by time, and what the activities of the living
entities are.

Out of these five basic subject matters in Bhagavad-gétä it is established that
the Supreme Godhead, or Kåñëa, or Brahman, or supreme controller, or
Paramätmä—you may use whatever name you like—is the greatest of all. The living
beings are in quality like the supreme controller. For instance, the Lord has
control over the universal affairs, over material nature, etc., as will be
explained in the later chapters of Bhagavad-gétä. Material nature is not
independant. She is acting under the directions of the Supreme Lord. As Lord
Kåñëa says, “Prakåti is working under My direction.” When we see wonderful
things happening in the cosmic nature, we should know that behind this cosmic
manifestation there is a controller. Nothing could be manifested without being
controlled. It is childish not to consider the controller. For instance, a child
may think that an automobile is quite wonderful to be able to run without a
horse or other animal pulling it, but a sane man knows the nature of the
automobile’s engineering arrangement. He always knows that behind the machinery
there is a man, a driver. Similarly, the Supreme Lord is a driver under whose
direction everything is working. Now the jévas, or the living entities, have
been accepted by the Lord, as we will note in the later chapters, as His parts
and parcels. A particle of gold is also gold, a drop of water from the ocean is
also salty, and similarly, we the living entities, being part and parcel of the
supreme controller, ésvara, or Bhagavän, Lord Çré Kåñëa, have all the qualities
of the Supreme Lord in minute quantity because we are minute éçvaras,
subordinate éçvaras. We are trying to control nature, as presently we are trying
to control space or planets, and this tendency to control is there because it is
in Kåñëa. But although we have a tendency to lord it over material nature, we
should know that we are not the supreme controller. This is explained in
Bhagavad-gétä.

What is material nature? This is also explained in Gétä as inferior prakåti,
inferior nature. The living entity is explained as the superior prakåti. Prakåti
is always under control, whether inferior or superior. Prakåti is female, and
she is controlled by the Lord just as the activities of a wife are controlled by
the husband. Prakåti is always subordinate, predominated by the Lord, who is the
predominator. The living entities and material nature are both predominated,
controlled by the Supreme Lord. According to the Gétä, the living entities,
although parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, are to be considered prakåti.
This is clearly mentioned in the Seventh Chapter, fifth verse of Bhagavad-gétä:
“Apareyam itas tv anyäm.” “This prakåti is My lower nature.” “Prakåtià viddhi me
paräm jéva-bhütäà mahä-bäho yayedaà dhäryate jagat.” And beyond this there is
another prakåti: jéva-bhütäm, the living entity.

Prakåti itself is constituted by three qualities: the mode of goodness, the mode
of passion and the mode of ignorance. Above these modes there is eternal time,
and by a combination of these modes of nature and under the control and purview
of eternal time there are activities which are called karma. These activities
are being carried out from time immemorial, and we are suffering or enjoying the
fruits of our activities. For instance, suppose I am a businessman and have
worked very hard with intelligence and have amassed a great bank balance. Then I
am an enjoyer. But then say I have lost all my money in business; then I am a
sufferer. Similarly, in every field of life we enjoy the results of our work, or
we suffer the results. This is called karma.

Éçvara (the Supreme Lord), jéva (the living entity), prakåti (nature), eternal
time and karma (activity) are all explained in the Bhagavad-gétä. Out of these
five, the Lord, the living entities, material nature and time are eternal. The
manifestation of prakåti may be temporary, but it is not false. Some
philosophers say that the manifestation of material nature is false, but
according to the philosophy of Bhagavad-gétä or according to the philosophy of
the Vaiñëavas, this is not so. The manifestation of the world is not accepted as
false; it is accepted as real, but temporary. It is likened unto a cloud which
moves across the sky, or the coming of the rainy season which nourishes grains.
As soon as the rainy season is over and as soon as the cloud goes away, all the
crops which were nourished by the rain dry up. Similarly, this material
manifestation takes place at a certain interval, stays for a while and then
disappears. Such are the workings of prakåti But this cycle is working
eternally. Therefore prakrti is eternal; it is not false. The Lord refers to
this as “My prakåti.” This material nature is the separated energy of the
Supreme Lord, and similarly the living entities are also the energy of the
Supreme Lord, but they are not separated. They are eternally related. So the
Lord, the living entity, material nature and time are all interrelated and are
all eternal. However, the other item, karma, is not eternal. The effects of
karma may be very old indeed. We are suffering or enjoying the results of our
activities from time immemorial, but we can change the results of our karma, or
our activity, and this change depends on the perfection of our knowledge. We are
engaged in various activities. Undoubtedly we do not know what sort of
activities we should adopt to gain relief from the actions and reactions of all
these activities, but this is also explained in the Bhagavad-gétä.

The position of ésvara is that of supreme consciousness. The jévas, or the
living entities, being parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, are also
conscious. Both the living entity and material nature are explained as prakåti,
the energy of the Supreme Lord, but one of the two, the jéva, is conscious. The
other prakåti is not conscious. That is the difference. Therefore the
jéva-prakåti is called superior because the jéva has consciousness which is
similar to the Lord’s. The Lord’s is supreme consciousness, however, and one
should not claim that the jéva, the living entity, is also supremely conscious.
The living being cannot be supremely conscious at any stage of his perfection,
and the theory that he can be so is a misleading theory. Conscious he may be,
but he is not perfectly or supremely conscious.

The distinction between the jéva and the éçvara will be explained in the
Thirteenth Chapter of Bhagavad-gétä. The Lord is kñetra-jïaù, conscious, as is
the living being, but the living being is conscious of his particular body,
whereas the Lord is conscious of all bodies. Because He lives in the heart of
every living being, He is conscious of the psychic movements of the particular
jévas. We should not forget this. It is also explained that the Paramätmä, the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, is living in everyone’s heart as éçvara, as the
controller, and that He is giving directions for the living entity to act as he
desires. The living entity forgets what to do. First of all he makes a
determination to act in a certain way, and then he is entangled in the acts and
reactions of his own karma. After giving up one type of body, he enters another
type of body, as we put on and take off old clothes. As the soul thus migrates,
he suffers the actions and reactions of his past activities. These activities
can be changed when the living being is in the mode of goodness, in sanity, and
understands what sort of activities he should adopt. If he does so, then all the
actions and reactions of his past activities can be changed. Consequently, karma
is not eternal. Therefore we stated that of the five items (éçvara, jéva,
prakåti time and karma) four are eternal, whereas karma is not eternal.

The supreme conscious éçvara is similar to the living entity in this way: both
the consciousness of the Lord and that of the living entity are transcendental.
It is not that consciousness is generated by the association of matter. That is
a mistaken idea. The theory that consciousness develops under certain
circumstances of material combination is not accepted in the Bhagavad-gétä.
Consciousness may be pervertedly reflected by the covering of material
circumstances, just as light reflected through colored glass may appear to be a
certain color, but the consciousness of the Lord is not materially affected.
Lord Kåñëa says, “mayädhyakñeëa prakåtiù.” When He descends into the material
universe, His consciousness is not materially affected. If He were so affected,
He would be unfit to speak on transcendental matters as He does in the
Bhagavad-gétä. One cannot say anything about the transcendental world without
being free from materially contaminated consciousness. So the Lord is not
materially contaminated. Our consciousness, at the present moment, however, is
materially contaminated. The Bhagavad-gétä teaches that we have to purify this
materially contaminated consciousness. In pure consciousness, our actions will
be dovetailed to the will of éçvara, and that will make us happy. It is not that
we have to cease all activities. Rather, our activities are to be purified, and
purified activities are called bhakti. Activities in bhakti appear to be like
ordinary activities, but they are not contaminated. An ignorant person may see
that a devotee is acting or working like an ordinary man, but such a person with
a poor fund of knowledge does not know that the activities of the devotee or of
the Lord are not contaminated by impure consciousness or matter. They are
transcendental to the three modes of nature. We should know, however, that at
this point our consciousness is contaminated.

When we are materially contaminated, we are called conditioned. False
consciousness is exhibited under the impression that I am a product of material
nature. This is called false ego. One who is absorbed in the thought of bodily
conceptions cannot understand his situation. Bhagavad-gétä was spoken to
liberate one from the bodily conception of life, and Arjuna put himself in this
position in order to receive this information from the Lord. One must become
free from the bodily conception of life; that is the preliminary activity for
the transcendentalist. One who wants to become free, who wants to become
liberated, must first of all learn that he is not this material body. Mukti or
liberation means freedom from material consciousness. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam
also the definition of liberation is given: Mukti means liberation from the
contaminated consciousness of this material world and situation in pure
consciousness. All the instructions of Bhagavad-gétä are intended to awaken this
pure consciousness, and therefore we find at the last stage of the Gétä’s
instructions that Kåñëa is asking Arjuna whether he is now in purified
consciousness. Purified consciousness means acting in accordance with the
instructions of the Lord. This is the whole sum and substance of purified
consciousness. Consciousness is already there because we are part and parcel of
the Lord, but for us there is the affinity of being affected by the inferior
modes. But the Lord, being the Supreme, is never affected. That is the
difference between the Supreme Lord and the conditioned souls.

What is this consciousness? This consciousness is “I am.” Then what am I? In
contaminated consciousness “I am” means “I am the lord of all I survey. I am the
enjoyer.” The world revolves because every living being thinks that he is the
lord and creator of the material world. Material consciousness has two psychic
divisions. One is that I am the creator, and the other is that I am the enjoyer.
But actually the Supreme Lord is both the creator and the enjoyer, and the
living entity, being part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, is neither the creator
nor the enjoyer, but a cooperator. He is the created and the enjoyed. For
instance, a part of a machine cooperates with the whole machine; a part of the
body cooperates with the whole body. The hands, feet, eyes, legs and so on are
all parts of the body, but they are not actually the enjoyers. The stomach is
the enjoyer. The legs move, the hands supply food, the teeth chew and all parts
of the body are engaged in satisfying the stomach because the stomach is the
principal factor that nourishes the body’s organization. Therefore everything is
given to the stomach. One nourishes the tree by watering its root, and one
nourishes the body by feeding the stomach, for if the body is to be kept in a
healthy state, then the parts of the body must cooperate to feed the stomach.
Similarly, the Supreme Lord is the enjoyer and the creator, and we, as
subordinate living beings, are meant to cooperate to satisfy Him. This
cooperation will actually help us, just as food taken by the stomach will help
all other parts of the body. If the fingers of the hand think that they should
take the food themselves instead of giving it to the stomach, then they will be
frustrated. The central figure of creation and of enjoyment is the Supreme Lord,
and the living entities are cooperators. By cooperation they enjoy. The relation
is also like that of the master and the servant. If the master is fully
satisfied, then the servant is satisfied. Similarly, the Supreme Lord should be
satisfied, although the tendency to become the creator and the tendency to enjoy
the material world are there also in the living entities because these
tendencies are there in the Supreme Lord who has created the manifested cosmic
world.

We shall find, therefore, in this Bhagavad-gétä that the complete whole is
comprised of the supreme controller, the controlled living entities, the cosmic
manifestation, eternal time, and karma, or activities, and all of these are
explained in this text. All of these taken completely form the complete whole,
and the complete whole is called the Supreme Absolute Truth. The complete whole
and the complete Absolute Truth are the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Çré
Kåñëa. All manifestations are due to His different energies. He is the complete
whole.

It is also explained in the Gétä that impersonal Brahman is also subordinate to
the complete. Brahman is more explicitly explained in the Brahma-sütra to be
like the rays of the sunshine. The impersonal Brahman is the shining rays of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. Impersonal Brahman is incomplete realization of
the absolute whole, and so also is the conception of Paramätmä in the Twelfth
Chapter. There it shall be seen that the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
Puruñottama, is above both impersonal Brahman and the partial realization of
Paramätmä. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is called sac-cid-änanda-vigraha.
The Brahma-saàhitä begins in this way: éçvaraù paramaù kåñëaù
sac-cid-änanda-vigrahaù/ anädir ädir govindaù sarva-käraëa-käraëam. “Kåñëa is
the cause of all causes. He is the primal cause, and He is the very form of
eternal being, knowledge and bliss.” Impersonal Brahman realization is the
realization of His sat (being) feature. Paramätmä realization is the realization
of the cit (eternal knowledge) feature. But realization of the Personality of
Godhead, Kåñëa, is realization of all the transcendental features: sat, cit and
änanda (being, knowledge, bliss) in complete vigraha (form).

People with less intelligence consider the Supreme Truth to be impersonal, but
He is a transcendental person, and this is confirmed in all Vedic literatures.
Nityo nityänäm cetanaç cetanänäm. As we are all individual living beings and
have our individuality, the Supreme Absolute Truth is also, in the ultimate
issue, a person, and realization of the Personality of Godhead is realization of
all of the transcendental features. The complete whole is not formless. If He is
formless, or if He is less than any other thing, then He cannot be the complete
whole. The complete whole must have everything within our experience and beyond
our experience, otherwise it cannot be complete. The complete whole, Personality
of Godhead, has immense potencies.

How Kåñëa is acting in different potencies is also explained in Bhagavad-gétä.
This phenomenal world or material world in which we are placed is also complete
in itself because the twenty-four elements of which this material universe is a
temporary manifestation, according to Säìkhya philosophy, are completely
adjusted to produce complete resources which are necessary for the maintenance
and subsistence of this universe. There is nothing extraneous; nor is there
anything needed. This manifestation has its own time fixed by the energy of the
supreme whole, and when its time is complete, these temporary manifestations
will be annihilated by the complete arrangement of the complete. There is
complete facility for the small complete units, namely the living entities, to
realize the complete, and all sorts of incompleteness are experienced due to
incomplete knowledge of the complete. So Bhagavad-gétä contains the complete
knowledge of Vedic wisdom.

All Vedic knowledge is infallible, and Hindus accept Vedic knowledge to be
complete and infallible. For example, cow dung is the stool of an animal, and
according to småti or Vedic injunction, if one touches the stool of an animal he
has to take a bath to purify himself. But in the Vedic scriptures cow dung is
considered to be a purifying agent. One might consider this to be contradictory,
but it is accepted because it is Vedic injunction, and indeed by accepting this,
one will not commit a mistake; subsequently it has been proved by modern science
that cow dung contains all antiseptic properties. So Vedic knowledge is complete
because it is above all doubts and mistakes, and Bhagavad-gétä is the essence of
all Vedic knowledge.

Vedic knowledge is not a question of research. Our research work is imperfect
because we are researching things with imperfect senses. We have to accept
perfect knowledge which comes down, as is stated in Bhagavad-gétä, by the
paramparä disciplic succession. We have to receive knowledge from the proper
source in disciplic succession beginning with the supreme spiritual master, the
Lord Himself, and handed down to a succession of spiritual masters. Arjuna, the
student who took lessons from Lord Çré Kåñëa, accepts everything that He says
without contradicting Him. One is not allowed to accept one portion of
Bhagavad-gétä and not another. No. We must accept Bhagavad-gétä without
interpretation, without deletion and without our own whimsical participation in
the matter. The Gétä should be taken as the most perfect presentation of Vedic
knowledge. Vedic knowledge is received from transcendental sources, and the
first words were spoken by the Lord Himself. The words spoken by the Lord are
different from words spoken by a person of the mundane world who is infected
with four defects. A mundaner 1) is sure to commit mistakes, 2) is invariably
illusioned, 3) has the tendency to cheat others and 4) is limited by imperfect
senses. With these four imperfections, one cannot deliver perfect information of
all-pervading knowledge.

Vedic knowledge is not imparted by such defective living entities. It was
imparted unto the heart of Brahmä, the first created living being, and Brahmä in
his turn disseminated this knowledge to his sons and disciples, as he originally
received it from the Lord. The Lord is pürëam, all-perfect, and there is no
possibility of His becoming subjected to the laws of material nature. One should
therefore be intelligent enough to know that the Lord is the only proprietor of
everything in the universe and that He is the original creator, the creator of
Brahmä. In the Eleventh Chapter the Lord is addressed as prapitämaha because
Brahmä is addressed as pitämaha, the grandfather, and He is the creator of the
grandfather. So no one should claim to be the proprietor of anything; one should
accept only things which are set aside for him by the Lord as his quota for his
maintenance.

There are many examples given of how we are to utilize those things which are
set aside for us by the Lord. This is also explained in Bhagavad-gétä. In the
beginning, Arjuna decided that he should not fight in the Battle of Kurukñetra.
This was his own decision. Arjuna told the Lord that it was not possible for him
to enjoy the kingdom after killing his own kinsmen. This decision was based on
the body because he was thinking that the body was himself and that his bodily
relations or expansions were his brothers, nephews, brothers-in-law,
grandfathers and so on. He was thinking in this way to satisfy his bodily
demands. Bhagavad-gétä was spoken by the Lord just to change this view, and at
the end Arjuna decides to fight under the directions of the Lord when he says,
“kariñye vacanaà tava.” “I shall act according to Thy word.”

In this world man is not meant to toil like hogs. He must be intelligent to
realize the importance of human life and refuse to act like an ordinary animal.
A human being should realize the aim of his life, and this direction is given in
all Vedic literatures, and the essence is given in Bhagavad-gétä. Vedic
literature is meant for human beings, not for animals. Animals can kill other
living animals, and there is no question of sin on their part, but if a man
kills an animal for the satisfaction of his uncontrolled taste, he must be
responsible for breaking the laws of nature. In the Bhagavad-gétä it is clearly
explained that there are three kinds of activities according to the different
modes of nature: the activities of goodness, of passion and of ignorance.
Similarly, there are three kinds of eatables also: eatables in goodness, passion
and ignorance. All of this is clearly described, and if we properly utilize the
instructions of Bhagavad-gétä, then our whole life will become purified, and
ultimately we will be able to reach the destination which is beyond this
material sky.

That destination is called the sanätana sky, the eternal spiritual sky. In this
material world we find that everything is temporary. It comes into being, stays
for some time, produces some by-products, dwindles and then vanishes. That is
the law of the material world, whether we use as an example this body, or a
piece of fruit or anything. But beyond this temporary world there is another
world of which we have information. This world consists of another nature which
is sanätana, eternal. Jéva is also described as sanätana, eternal, and the Lord
is also described as sanätana in the Eleventh Chapter. We have an intimate
relationship with the Lord, and because we are all qualitatively one—the
sanätana-dhäma, or sky, the sanätana Supreme Personality and the sanätana living
entities—the whole purpose of Bhagavad-gétä is to revive our sanätana
occupation, or sanätana-dharma, which is the eternal occupation of the living
entity. We are temporarily engaged in different activities, but all of these
activities can be purified when we give up all these temporary activities and
take up the activities which are prescribed by the Supreme Lord. That is called
our pure life.

The Supreme Lord and His transcendental abode are both sanätana, as are the
living entities, and the combined association of the Supreme Lord and the living
entities in the sanätana abode is the perfection of human life. The Lord is very
kind to the living entities because they are His sons. Lord Kåñëa declares in
Bhagavad-gétä, “sarva-yoniñu…ahaà béja-pradaù pitä.” “I am the father of all.”
Of course there are all types of living entities according to their various
karmas, but here the Lord claims that He is the father of all of them. Therefore
the Lord descends to reclaim all of these fallen, conditioned souls to call them
back to the sanätana eternal sky so that the sanätana living entities may regain
their eternal sanätana positions in eternal association with the Lord. The Lord
comes Himself in different incarnations, or He sends His confidential servants
as sons or His associates or äcäryas to reclaim the conditioned souls.

Therefore, sanätana-dharma does not refer to any sectarian process of religion.
It is the eternal function of the eternal living entities in relationship with
the eternal Supreme Lord. Sanätana-dharma refers, as stated previously, to the
eternal occupation of the living entity. Rämänujäcärya has explained the word
sanätana as “that which has neither beginning nor end,” so when we speak of
sanätana-dharma, we must take it for granted on the authority of Çré
Rämänujäcärya that it has neither beginning nor end.

The English word “religion” is a little different from sanätana-dharma. Religion
conveys the idea of faith, and faith may change. One may have faith in a
particular process, and he may change this faith and adopt another, but
sanätana-dharma refers to that activity which cannot be changed. For instance,
liquidity cannot be taken from water, nor can heat be taken from fire.
Similarly, the eternal function of the eternal living entity cannot be taken
from the living entity. Sanätana-dharma is eternally integral with the living
entity. When we speak of sanätana-dharma, therefore, we must take it for granted
on the authority of Çré Rämänujäcärya that it has neither beginning nor end.
That which has neither end nor beginning must not be sectarian, for it cannot be
limited by any boundaries. Yet those belonging to some sectarian faith will
wrongly consider that sanätana-dharma is also sectarian, but if we go deeply
into the matter and consider it in the light of modern science, it is possible
for us to see that sanätana-dharma is the business of all the people of the
world—nay, of all the living entities of the universe.

Non-sanätana religious faith may have some beginning in the annals of human
history, but there is no beginning to the history of sanätana-dharma because it
remains eternally with the living entities. Insofar as the living entities are
concerned, the authoritative çästras state that the living entity has neither
birth nor death. In the Gétä it is stated that the living entity is never born,
and he never dies. He is eternal and indestructible, and he continues to live
after the destruction of his temporary material body. In reference to the
concept of sanätana-dharma, we must try to understand the concept of religion
from the Sanskrit root meaning of the word. Dharma refers to that which is
constantly existing with the particular object. We conclude that there is heat
and light along with the fire; without heat and light, there is no meaning to
the word fire. Similarly, we must discover the essential part of the living
being, that part which is his constant companion. That constant companion is his
eternal quality, and that eternal quality is his eternal religion.

When Sanätana Gosvämé asked Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu about the svarüpa of every
living being, the Lord replied that the svarüpa or constitutional position of
the living being is the rendering of service to the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. If we analyze this statement of Lord Caitanya, we can easily see that
every living being is constantly engaged in rendering service to another living
being. A living being serves other living beings in two capacities. By doing so,
the living entity enjoys life. The lower animals serve human beings as servants
serve their master. A serves B master, B serves C master and C serves D master
and so on. Under these circumstances, we can see that one friend serves another
friend, the mother serves the son, the wife serves the husband, the husband
serves the wife and so on. If we go on searching in this spirit, it will be seen
that there is no exception in the society of living beings to the activity of
service. The politician presents his manifesto for the public to convince them
of his capacity for service. The voters therefore give the politician their
valuable votes, thinking that he will render valuable service to society. The
shopkeeper serves the customer, and the artisan serves the capitalist. The
capitalist serves the family, and the family serves the state in the terms of
the eternal capacity of the eternal living being. In this way we can see that no
living being is exempt from rendering service to other living beings, and
therefore we can safely conclude that service is the constant companion of the
living being and that the rendering of service is the eternal religion of the
living being.

Yet man professes to belong to a particular type of faith with reference to
particular time and circumstance and thus claims to be a Hindu, Muslim,
Christian, Buddhist or any other sect. Such designations are
non-sanätana-dharma. A Hindu may change his faith to become a Muslim, or a
Muslim may change his faith to become a Hindu, or a Christian may change his
faith and so on. But in all circumstances the change of religious faith does not
effect the eternal occupation of rendering service to others. The Hindu, Muslim
or Christian in all circumstances is servant of someone. Thus, to profess a
particular type of sect is not to profess one’s sanätana-dharma. The rendering
of service is sanätana-dharma.

Factually we are related to the Supreme Lord in service. The Supreme Lord is the
supreme enjoyer, and we living entities are His servitors. We are created for
His enjoyment, and if we participate in that eternal enjoyment with the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, we become happy. We cannot become happy otherwise. It is
not possible to be happy independantly, just as no one part of the body can be
happy without cooperating with the stomach. It is not possible for the living
entity to be happy without rendering transcendental loving service unto the
Supreme Lord.

In the Bhagavad-gétä, worship of different demigods or rendering service to them
is not approved. It is stated in the Seventh Chapter, twentieth verse:

kämais tais tair håta-jïänäù prapadyante ’nya-devatäù
taà taà niyamam ästhäya prakåtyä niyatäù svayä

“Those whose minds are distorted by material desires surrender unto demigods and
follow the particular rules and regulations of worship according to their own
natures.” (Bg. 7.20) Here it is plainly said that those who are directed by lust
worship the demigods and not the Supreme Lord Kåñëa. When we mention the name
Kåñëa, we do not refer to any sectarian name. Kåñëa means the highest pleasure,
and it is confirmed that the Supreme Lord is the reservoir or storehouse of all
pleasure. We are all hankering after pleasure. Änandamayo ’bhyäsät. (Vs. 1.1.12)
The living entities, like the Lord, are full of consciousness, and they are
after happiness. The Lord is perpetually happy, and if the living entities
associate with the Lord, cooperate with Him and take part in His association,
then they also become happy.

The Lord descends to this mortal world to show His pastimes in Våndävana, which
are full of happiness. When Lord Çré Kåñëa was in Våndävana, His activities with
His cowherd boy friends, with His damsel friends, with the inhabitants of
Våndävana and with the cows were all full of happiness. The total population of
Våndävana knew nothing but Kåñëa. But Lord Kåñëa even discouraged His father
Nanda Mahäräja from worshiping the demigod Indra because He wanted to establish
the fact that people need not worship any demigod. They need only worship the
Supreme Lord because their ultimate goal is to return to His abode.

The abode of Lord Çré Kåñëa is described in the Bhagavad-gétä, Fifteenth
Chapter, sixth verse:

na tad bhäsayate süryo na çaçäìko na pävakaù
yad gatvä na nivartante tad dhäma paramaà mama

“That abode of Mine is not illumined by the sun or moon, nor by electricity. And
anyone who reaches it never comes back to this material world.” (Bg. 15.6)

This verse gives a description of that eternal sky. Of course we have a material
conception of the sky, and we think of it in relationship to the sun, moon,
stars and so on, but in this verse the Lord states that in the eternal sky there
is no need for the sun nor for the moon nor fire of any kind because the
spiritual sky is already illuminated by the brahmajyoti, the rays emanating from
the Supreme Lord. We are trying with difficulty to reach other planets, but it
is not difficult to understand the abode of the Supreme Lord. This abode is
referred to as Goloka. In the Brahma-saàhitä it is beautifully described: Goloka
eva nivasaty akhilätma-bhütaù. The Lord resides eternally in His abode Goloka,
yet He can be approached from this world, and to this end the Lord comes to
manifest His real form, sac-cid-änanda-vigraha. When He manifests this form,
there is no need for our imagining what He looks like. To discourage such
imaginative speculation, He descends and exhibits Himself as He is, as
Çyämasundara. Unfortunately, the less intelligent deride Him because He comes as
one of us and plays with us as a human being. But because of this we should not
consider that the Lord is one of us. It is by His potency that He presents
Himself in His real form before us and displays His pastimes, which are
prototypes of those pastimes found in His abode.

In the effulgent rays of the spiritual sky there are innumerable planets
floating. The brahmajyoti emanates from the supreme abode, Kåñëaloka, and the
änandamaya-cinmaya planets, which are not material, float in those rays. The
Lord says, na tad bhäsayate süryo na çaçäìko na pävakaù yad gatvä na nivartante
tad dhäma paramaà mama. One who can approach that spiritual sky is not required
to descend again to the material sky. In the material sky, even if we approach
the highest planet (Brahmaloka), what to speak of the moon, we will find the
same conditions of life, namely birth, death, disease and old age. No planet in
the material universe is free from these four principles of material existence.
Therefore the Lord says in Bhagavad-gétä, äbrahma-bhuvanäl lokäù punar ävartino
’rjuna. The living entities are traveling from one planet to another, not by
mechanical arrangement but by a spiritual process. This is also mentioned: yänti
deva-vratä devän pitèn yänti pitå-vratäù. No mechanical arrangement is necessary
if we want interplanetary travel. The Gétä instructs: yänti deva-vratä devän.
The moon, the sun and higher planets are called svargaloka. There are three
different statuses of planets: higher, middle and lower planetary systems. The
earth belongs to the middle planetary system. Bhagavad-gétä informs us how to
travel to the higher planetary systems (devaloka) with a very simple formula:
yänti deva-vratä devän. One need only worship the particular demigod of that
particular planet and in that way go to the moon, the sun or any of the higher
planetary systems.

Yet Bhagavad-gétä does not advise us to go to any of the planets in this
material world because even if we go to Brahmaloka, the highest planet, through
some sort of mechanical contrivance by maybe traveling for forty thousand years
(and who would live that long?), we will still find the material inconveniences
of birth, death, disease and old age. But one who wants to approach the supreme
planet, Kåñëaloka, or any of the other planets within the spiritual sky, will
not meet with these material inconveniences. Amongst all of the planets in the
spiritual sky there is one supreme planet called Goloka Våndävana, which is the
original planet in the abode of the original Personality of Godhead Çré Kåñëa.
All of this information is given in Bhagavad-gétä, and we are given through its
instruction information how to leave the material world and begin a truly
blissful life in the spiritual sky.

In the Fifteenth Chapter of the Bhagavad-gétä, the real picture of the material
world is given. It is said there:

ürdhva-mülam adhaù-çäkham açvatthaà prähur avyayam
chandäàsi yasya parëäni yas taà veda sa veda-vit

“The Supreme Lord said: There is a banyan tree which has its roots upward and
its branches down, and the Vedic hymns are its leaves. One who knows this tree
is the knower of the Vedas.” (Bg. 15.1) Here the material world is described as
a tree whose roots are upwards and branches are below. We have experience of a
tree whose roots are upward: if one stands on the bank of a river or any
reservoir of water, he can see that the trees reflected in the water are upside
down. The branches go downward and the roots upward. Similarly, this material
world is a reflection of the spiritual world. The material world is but a shadow
of reality. In the shadow there is no reality or substantiality, but from the
shadow we can understand that there is substance and reality. In the desert
there is no water, but the mirage suggests that there is such a thing as water.
In the material world there is no water, there is no happiness, but the real
water of actual happiness is there in the spiritual world.

The Lord suggests that we attain the spiritual world in the following manner:

nirmäna-mohä jita-saìga-doñä
adhyätma-nityä vinivåtta-kämäù
dvandvair vimuktäù sukha-duùkha-saàjïair
gacchanty amüòhäù padam avyayaà tat.

That padam avyayam or eternal kingdom can be reached by one who is nirmäna-moha.
What does this mean? We are after designations. Someone wants to become a son,
someone wants to become Lord, someone wants to become the president or a rich
man or a king or something else. As long as we are attached to these
designations, we are attached to the body because designations belong to the
body. But we are not these bodies, and realizing this is the first stage in
spiritual realization. We are associated with the three modes of material
nature, but we must become detached through devotional service to the Lord. If
we are not attached to devotional service to the Lord, then we cannot become
detached from the modes of material nature. Designations and attachments are due
to our lust and desire, our wanting to lord it over the material nature. As long
as we do not give up this propensity of lording it over material nature, there
is no possibility of returning to the kingdom of the Supreme, the
sanätana-dhäma. That eternal kingdom, which is never destroyed, can be
approached by one who is not bewildered by the attractions of false material
enjoyments, who is situated in the service of the Supreme Lord. One so situated
can easily approach that supreme abode.

Elsewhere in the Gétä it is stated:

avyakto ’kñara ity uktas tam ähuù paramäà gatim
yaà präpya na nivartante tad dhäma paramaà mama.

Avyakta means unmanifested. Not even all of the material world is manifested
before us. Our senses are so imperfect that we cannot even see all of the stars
within this material universe. In Vedic literature we can receive much
information about all the planets, and we can believe it or not believe it. All
of the important planets are described in Vedic literatures, especially
Çrémad-Bhägavatam, and the spiritual world, which is beyond this material sky,
is described as avyakta, unmanifested. One should desire and hanker after that
supreme kingdom, for when one attains that kingdom, he does not have to return
to this material world.

Next, one may raise the question of how one goes about approaching that abode of
the Supreme Lord. Information of this is given in the Eighth Chapter. It is said
there:

anta-käle ca mäm eva smaran muktvä kalevaram
yaù prayäti sa mad-bhävam yäti nästy atra saàçayaù

“Anyone who quits his body, at the end of life, remembering Me, attains
immediately to My nature; and there is no doubt of this.” (Bg. 8.5) One who
thinks of Kåñëa at the time of his death goes to Kåñëa. One must remember the
form of Kåñëa; if he quits his body thinking of this form, he approaches the
spiritual kingdom. Mad-bhävaà refers to the supreme nature of the Supreme Being.
The Supreme Being is sac-cid-änanda-vigraha—eternal, full of knowledge and
bliss. Our present body is not sac-cid-änanda. It is asat, not sat. It is not
eternal; it is perishable. It is not cit, full of knowledge, but it is full of
ignorance. We have no knowledge of the spiritual kingdom, nor do we even have
perfect knowledge of this material world where there are so many things unknown
to us. The body is also niränanda; instead of being full of bliss it is full of
misery. All of the miseries we experience in the material world arise from the
body, but one who leaves this body thinking of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead at once attains a sac-cid-änanda body, as is promised in this fifth
verse of the Eighth Chapter where Lord Kåñëa says, “He attains My nature.”

The process of quitting this body and getting another body in the material world
is also organized. A man dies after it has been decided what form of body he
will have in the next life. Higher authorities, not the living entity himself,
make this decision. According to our activities in this life, we either rise or
sink. This life is a preparation for the next life. If we can prepare,
therefore, in this life to get promotion to the kingdom of God, then surely,
after quitting this material body, we will attain a spiritual body just like the
Lord.

As explained before, there are different kinds of transcendentalists, the
brahmavädi, paramätmävädi and the devotee, and, as mentioned, in the brahmajyoti
(spiritual sky) there are innumerable spiritual planets. The number of these
planets is far, far greater than all of the planets of this material world. This
material world has been approximated as only one quarter of the creation. In
this material segment there are millions and billions of universes with
trillions of planets and suns, stars and moons. But this whole material creation
is only a fragment of the total creation. Most of the creation is in the
spiritual sky. One who desires to merge into the existence of the Supreme
Brahman is at once transferred to the brahmajyoti of the Supreme Lord and thus
attains the spiritual sky. The devotee, who wants to enjoy the association of
the Lord, enters into the Vaikuëöha planets, which are innumerable, and the
Supreme Lord by His plenary expansions as Näräyaëa with four hands and with
different names like Pradyumna, Aniruddha, Govinda, etc., associates with him
there. Therefore at the end of life the transcendentalists either think of the
brahmajyoti, the Paramätmä or the Supreme Personality of Godhead Çré Kåñëa. In
all cases they enter into the spiritual sky, but only the devotee, or he who is
in personal touch with the Supreme Lord, enters into the Vaikuëöha planets. The
Lord further adds that of this “there is no doubt.” This must be believed
firmly. We should not reject that which does not tally with our imagination; our
attitude should be that of Arjuna: “I believe everything that You have said.”
Therefore when the Lord says that at the time of death whoever thinks of Him as
Brahman or Paramätmä or as the Personality of Godhead certainly enters into the
spiritual sky, there is no doubt about it. There is no question of disbelieving
it.

The information on how to think of the Supreme Being at the time of death is
also given in the Gétä:

yaà yaà väpi smaran bhävaà tyajaty ante kalevaram
taà tam evaiti kaunteya sadä tad-bhäva-bhävitaù

“In whatever condition one quits his present body, in his next life he will
attain to that state of being without fail.” (Bg. 8.6) Material nature is a
display of one of the energies of the Supreme Lord. In the Viñëu Puräëa the
total energies of the Supreme Lord as Viñëu-çaktiù parä proktä, etc., are
delineated. The Supreme Lord has diverse and innumerable energies which are
beyond our conception; however, great learned sages or liberated souls have
studied these energies and have analyzed them into three parts. All of the
energies are of Viñëu-çakti, that is to say they are different potencies of Lord
Viñëu. That energy is parä, transcendental. Living entities also belong to the
superior energy, as has already been explained. The other energies, or material
energies, are in the mode of ignorance. At the time of death we can either
remain in the inferior energy of this material world, or we can transfer to the
energy of the spiritual world.

In life we are accustomed to thinking either of the material or the spiritual
energy. There are so many literatures which fill our thoughts with the material
energy—newspapers, novels, etc. Our thinking, which is now absorbed in these
literatures, must be transferred to the Vedic literatures. The great sages,
therefore, have written so many Vedic literatures such as the Puräëas, etc. The
Puräëas are not imaginative; they are historical records. In the
Caitanya-caritämåta there is the following verse:

mäyä mugdha jéver nähi svataù kåñëa-jïäna
jévera kåpäya kailä kåñëa veda-puräëa

(Cc. Madhya 20.122)

The forgetful living entities or conditioned souls have forgotten their
relationship with the Supreme Lord, and they are engrossed in thinking of
material activities. Just to transfer their thinking power to the spiritual sky,
Kåñëa has given a great number of Vedic literatures. First He divided the Vedas
into four, then He explained them in the Puräëas, and for less capable people He
wrote the Mahäbhärata. In the Mahäbhärata there is given the Bhagavad-gétä. Then
all Vedic literature is summarized in the Vedänta-sütra, and for future guidance
He gave a natural commentation on the Vedänta-sutra, called Çrémad-Bhägavatam.
We must always engage our minds in reading these Vedic literatures. Just as
materialists engage their minds in reading newspapers, magazines and so many
materialistic literatures, we must transfer our reading to these literatures
which are given to us by Vyäsadeva; in that way it will be possible for us to
remember the Supreme Lord at the time of death. That is the only way suggested
by the Lord, and He guarantees the result: “There is no doubt.” (Bg. 8.7)

tasmät sarveñu käleñu mäm anusmara yudhya ca
mayy arpita-mano-buddhir mäm evaiñyasy asaàçayaù

“Therefore, Arjuna, you should always think of Me, and at the same time you
should continue your prescribed duty and fight. With your mind and activities
always fixed on Me, and everything engaged in Me, you will attain to Me without
any doubt.”

He does not advise Arjuna to simply remember Him and give up his occupation. No,
the Lord never suggests anything impractical. In this material world, in order
to maintain the body one has to work. Human society is divided, according to
work, into four divisions of social order—brähmaëa, kñatriya, vaiçya, çüdra. The
brähmaëa class or intelligent class is working in one way, the kñatriya or
administrative class is working in another way, and the mercantile class and the
laborers are all tending to their specific duties. In the human society, whether
one is a laborer, merchant, warrior, administrator, or farmer, or even if one
belongs to the highest class and is a literary man, a scientist or a theologian,
he has to work in order to maintain his existence. The Lord therefore tells
Arjuna that he need not give up his occupation, but while he is engaged in his
occupation he should remember Kåñëa. If he doesn’t practice remembering Kåñëa
while he is struggling for existence, then it will not be possible for him to
remember Kåñëa at the time of death. Lord Caitanya also advises this. He says
that one should practice remembering the Lord by chanting the names of the Lord
always. The names of the Lord and the Lord are nondifferent. So Lord Kåñëa’s
instruction to Arjuna to “remember Me” and Lord Caitanya’s injunction to always
“chant the names of Lord Kåñëa” are the same instruction. There is no
difference, because Kåñëa and Kåñëa’s name are nondifferent. In the absolute
status there is no difference between reference and referent. Therefore we have
to practice remembering the Lord always, twenty-four hours a day, by chanting
His names and molding our life’s activities in such a way that we can remember
Him always.

How is this possible? The äcäryas give the following example. If a married woman
is attached to another man, or if a man has an attachment for a woman other than
his wife, then the attachment is to be considered very strong. One with such an
attachment is always thinking of the loved one. The wife who is thinking of her
lover is always thinking of meeting him, even while she is carrying out her
household chores. In fact, she carries out her household work even more
carefully so her husband will not suspect her attachment. Similarly, we should
always remember the supreme lover, Çré Kåñëa, and at the same time perform our
material duties very nicely. A strong sense of love is required here. If we have
a strong sense of love for the Supreme Lord, then we can discharge our duty and
at the same time remember Him. But we have to develop that sense of love.
Arjuna, for instance, was always thinking of Kåñëa; he was the constant
companion of Kåñëa, and at the same time he was a warrior. Kåñëa did not advise
him to give up fighting and go to the forest to meditate. When Lord Kåñëa
delineates the yoga system to Arjuna, Arjuna says that the practice of this
system is not possible for him.

arjuna uväca
yo ’yaà yogas tvayä proktaù sämyena madhusüdana
etasyähaà na paçyämi caïcalatvät sthitià sthiräm

“Arjuna said, O Madhusüdana, the system of yoga which you have summarized
appears impractical and unendurable to me, for the mind is restless and
unsteady.” (Bg. 6.33)

But the Lord says:

yoginäm api sarveñäà mad-gatenäntarätmanä
çraddhävän bhajate yo mäà sa me yuktatamo mataù

“Of all yogés, he who always abides in Me with great faith, worshiping Me in
transcendental loving service, is most intimately united with Me in yoga, and is
the highest of all.” (Bg. 6.47) So one who thinks of the Supreme Lord always is
the greatest yogé, the supermost jïäné, and the greatest devotee at the same
time. The Lord further tells Arjuna that as a kñatriya he cannot give up his
fighting, but if Arjuna fights remembering Kåñëa, then he will be able to
remember Him at the time of death. But one must be completely surrendered in the
transcendental loving service of the Lord.

We work not with our body, actually, but with our mind and intelligence. So if
the intelligence and the mind are always engaged in the thought of the Supreme
Lord, then naturally the senses are also engaged in His service. Superficially,
at least, the activities of the senses remain the same, but the consciousness is
changed. The Bhagavad-gétä teaches one how to absorb the mind and intelligence
in the thought of the Lord. Such absorption will enable one to transfer himself
to the kingdom of the Lord. If the mind is engaged in Kåñëa’s service, then the
senses are automatically engaged in His service. This is the art, and this is
also the secret of Bhagavad-gétä: total absorption in the thought of Çré Kåñëa.

Modern man has struggled very hard to reach the moon, but he has not tried very
hard to elevate himself spiritually. If one has fifty years of life ahead of
him, he should engage that brief time in cultivating this practice of
remembering the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This practice is the devotional
process of:

çravaëaà kértanaà viñëoù smaraëaà päda-sevanam
arcanaà vandanaà däsyaà sakhyam ätma-nivedanam

These nine processes, of which the easiest is çravaëaà, hearing Bhagavad-gétä
from the realized person, will turn one to the thought of the Supreme Being.
This will lead to niçcala, remembering the Supreme Lord, and will enable one,
upon leaving the body, to attain a spiritual body which is just fit for
association with the Supreme Lord.

The Lord further says:

abhyäsa-yoga-yuktena cetasä nänya-gäminä
paramaà puruñaà divyaà yäti pärthänucintayan

“By practicing this remembering, without being deviated, thinking ever of the
Supreme Godhead, one is sure to achieve the planet of the Divine, the Supreme
Personality, O son of Kunté.” (Bg. 8.8)

This is not a very difficult process. However, one must learn it from an
experienced person, from one who is already in the practice. The mind is always
flying to this and that, but one must always practice concentrating the mind on
the form of the Supreme Lord Çré Kåñëa or on the sound of His name. The mind is
naturally restless, going hither and thither, but it can rest in the sound
vibration of Kåñëa. One must thus meditate on paramaà puruñaà, the Supreme
Person; and thus attain Him. The ways and the means for ultimate realization,
ultimate attainment, are stated in the Bhagavad-gétä, and the doors of this
knowledge are open for everyone. No one is barred out. All classes of men can
approach the Lord by thinking of Him, for hearing and thinking of Him is
possible for everyone.

The Lord further says:

mäà hi pärtha vyapäçritya ye ’pi syuù päpa-yonayaù
striyo vaiçyäs tathä çüdräs te ’pi yänti paräà gatim

kià punar brähmaëäù puëyä bhaktä räjarñayas tathä
anityam asukhaà lokam imaà präpya bhajasva mäm

“O son of Påthä, anyone who will take shelter in Me, whether a woman, or a
merchant, or one born in a low family, can yet approach the supreme destination.
How much greater then are the brähmaëas, the righteous, the devotees, and
saintly kings! In this miserable world, these are fixed in devotional service to
the Lord.” (Bg. 9.32–33)

Human beings even in the lower statuses of life (a merchant, a woman or a
laborer) can attain the Supreme. One does not need highly developed
intelligence. The point is that anyone who accepts the principle of bhakti-yoga
and accepts the Supreme Lord as the summum bonum of life, as the highest target,
the ultimate goal, can approach the Lord in the spiritual sky. If one adopts the
principles enunciated in Bhagavad-gétä, he can make his life perfect and make a
perfect solution to all the problems of life which arise out of the transient
nature of material existence. This is the sum and substance of the entire
Bhagavad-gétä.

In conclusion, Bhagavad-géta is a transcendental literature which one should
read very carefully. It is capable of saving one from all fear.

nehäbhikrama-näço ’sti pratyaväyo na vidyate
svalpam apy asya dharmasya träyate mahato bhayät

“In this endeavor there is no loss or diminution, and a little advancement on
this path can protect one from the most dangerous type of fear.” (Bg. 2.40) If
one reads Bhagavad-gétä sincerely and seriously, then all of the reactions of
his past misdeeds will not react upon him. In the last portion of Bhagavad-gétä,
Lord Çré Kåñëa proclaims:

sarva-dharmän parityajya mäm ekaà çaraëaà vraja
ahaà tväà sarva-päpebhyo mokñayiñyämi mä çucaù

“Give up all varieties of religiousness, and just surrender unto Me; and in
return I shall protect you from all sinful reactions. Therefore, you have
nothing to fear.” (Bg. 18.66) Thus the Lord takes all responsibility for one who
surrenders unto Him, and He indemnifies all the reactions of sin.

One cleanses himself daily by taking a bath in water, but one who takes his bath
only once in the sacred Ganges water of the Bhagavad-gétä cleanses away all the
dirt of material life. Because Bhagavad-gétä is spoken by the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, one need not read any other Vedic literature. One need
only attentively and regularly hear and read Bhagavad-gétä. In the present age,
mankind is so absorbed with mundane activities that it is not possible to read
all of the Vedic literatures. But this is not necessary. This one book,
Bhagavad-gétä, will suffice because it is the essence of all Vedic literatures
and because it is spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is said that
one who drinks the water of the Ganges certainly gets salvation, but what to
speak of one who drinks the waters of Bhagavad-gétä? Gétä is the very nectar of
the Mahäbhärata spoken by Viñëu Himself, for Lord Kåñëa is the original Viñëu.
It is nectar emanating from the mouth of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and
the Ganges is said to be emanating from the lotus feet of the Lord. Of course
there is no difference between the mouth and the feet of the Supreme Lord, but
in our position we can appreciate that the Bhagavad-gétä is even more important
than the Ganges.

The Bhagavad-gétä is just like a cow, and Lord Kåñëa, who is a cowherd boy, is
milking this cow. The milk is the essence of the Vedas, and Arjuna is just like
a calf. The wise men, the great sages and pure devotees, are to drink the
nectarean milk of Bhagavad-gétä.

In this present day, man is very eager to have one scripture, one God, one
religion, and one occupation. So let there be one common scripture for the whole
world—Bhagavad-gétä. And let there be one God only for the whole world—Çré
Kåñëa. And one mantra only—Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare
Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare. And let there be one work only—the
service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

TRANSLATION
Dhåtaräñöra said: O Saïjaya, after assembling in the place of pilgrimage at
Kurukñetra, what did my sons and the sons of Päëòu do, being desirous to fight?

PURPORT
Bhagavad-gétä is the widely read theistic science summarized in the
Gétä-mähätmya (Glorification of the Gétä). There it says that one should read
Bhagavad-gétä very scrutinizingly with the help of a person who is a devotee of
Çré Kåñëa and try to understand it without personally motivated interpretations.
The example of clear understanding is there in the Bhagavad-gétä itself, in the
way the teaching is understood by Arjuna, who heard the Gétä directly from the
Lord. If someone is fortunate enough to understand Bhagavad-gétä in that line of
disciplic succession, without motivated interpretation, then he surpasses all
studies of Vedic wisdom, and all scriptures of the world. One will find in the
Bhagavad-gétä all that is contained in other scriptures, but the reader will
also find things which are not to be found elsewhere. That is the specific
standard of the Gétä. It is the perfect theistic science because it is directly
spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Çré Kåñëa.

The topics discussed by Dhåtaräñöra and Saïjaya, as described in the
Mahäbhärata, form the basic principle for this great philosophy. It is
understood that this philosophy evolved on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra, which
is a sacred place of pilgrimage from the immemorial time of the Vedic age. It
was spoken by the Lord when He was present personally on this planet for the
guidance of mankind.

The word dharma-kñetra (a place where religious rituals are performed) is
significant because, on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra, the Supreme Personality
of Godhead was present on the side of Arjuna. Dhåtaräñöra, the father of the
Kurus, was highly doubtful about the possibility of his sons’ ultimate victory.
In his doubt, he inquired from his secretary Saïjaya, “What did my sons and the
sons of Päëòu do?” He was confident that both his sons and the sons of his
younger brother Päëòu were assembled in that Field of Kurukñetra for a
determined engagement of the war. Still, his inquiry is significant. He did not
want a compromise between the cousins and brothers, and he wanted to be sure of
the fate of his sons on the battlefield. Because the battle was arranged to be
fought at Kurukñetra, which is mentioned elsewhere in the Vedas as a place of
worship—even for the denizens of heaven—Dhåtaräñöra became very fearful about
the influence of the holy place on the outcome of the battle. He knew very well
that this would influence Arjuna and the sons of Päëòu favorably, because by
nature they were all virtuous. Saïjaya was a student of Vyäsa, and therefore, by
the mercy of Vyäsa, Saïjaya was able to envision the Battlefield of Kurukñetra
even while he was in the room of Dhåtaräñöra. And so, Dhåtaräñöra asked him
about the situation on the battlefield.

Both the Päëòavas and the sons of Dhåtaräñöra belong to the same family, but
Dhåtaräñöra’s mind is disclosed herein. He deliberately claimed only his sons as
Kurus, and he separated the sons of Päëòu from the family heritage. One can thus
understand the specific position of Dhåtaräñöra in his relationship with his
nephews, the sons of Päëòu. As in the paddy field the unnecessary plants are
taken out, so it is expected from the very beginning of these topics that in the
religious field of Kurukñetra where the father of religion, Çré Kåñëa, was
present, the unwanted plants like Dhåtaräñöra’s son Duryodhana and others would
be wiped out and the thoroughly religious persons, headed by Yudhiñöhira, would
be established by the Lord. This is the significance of the words dharma-kñetre
and kuru-kñetre, apart from their historical and Vedic importance.

TRANSLATION
Saïjaya said: O King, after looking over the army gathered by the sons of Päëòu,
King Duryodhana went to his teacher and began to speak the following words:

PURPORT
Dhåtaräñöra was blind from birth. Unfortunately, he was also bereft of spiritual
vision. He knew very well that his sons were equally blind in the matter of
religion, and he was sure that they could never reach an understanding with the
Päëòavas, who were all pious since birth. Still he was doubtful about the
influence of the place of pilgrimage, and Saïjaya could understand his motive in
asking about the situation on the battlefield. He wanted, therefore, to
encourage the despondent King, and thus he warned him that his sons were not
going to make any sort of compromise under the influence of the holy place.
Saïjaya therefore informed the King that his son, Duryodhana, after seeing the
military force of the Päëòavas, at once went to the commander-in-chief,
Droëäcärya, to inform him of the real position. Although Duryodhana is mentioned
as the king, he still had to go to the commander on account of the seriousness
of the situation. He was therefore quite fit to be a politician. But
Duryodhana’s diplomatic veneer could not disguise the fear he felt when he saw
the military arrangement of the Päëòavas.

TRANSLATION
O my teacher, behold the great army of the sons of Päëòu, so expertly arranged
by your intelligent disciple, the son of Drupada.

PURPORT
Duryodhana, a great diplomat, wanted to point out the defects of Droëäcärya, the
great brähmaëa commander-in-chief. Droëäcärya had some political quarrel with
King Drupada, the father of Draupadé, who was Arjuna’s wife. As a result of this
quarrel, Drupada performed a great sacrifice, by which he received the
benediction of having a son who would be able to kill Droëäcärya. Droëäcärya
knew this perfectly well, and yet, as a liberal brähmaëa, he did not hesitate to
impart all his military secrets when the son of Drupada, Dhåñöadyumna, was
entrusted to him for military education. Now, on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra,
Dhåñöadyumna took the side of the Päëòavas, and it was he who arranged for their
military phalanx, after having learned the art from Droëäcärya. Duryodhana
pointed out this mistake of Droëäcärya’s so that he might be alert and
uncompromising in the fighting. By this he wanted to point out also that he
should not be similarly lenient in battle against the Päëòavas, who were also
Droëäcärya’s affectionate students. Arjuna, especially, was his most
affectionate and brilliant student. Duryodhana also warned that such leniency in
the fight would lead to defeat.

Here in this army there are many heroic bowmen equal in fighting to Bhéma and
Arjuna; there are also great fighters like Yuyudhäna, Viräöa and Drupada.

PURPORT
Even though Dhåñöadyumna was not a very important obstacle in the face of
Droëäcärya’s very great power in the military art, there were many others who
were the cause of fear. They are mentioned by Duryodhana as great stumbling
blocks on the path of victory because each and every one of them was as
formidable as Bhéma and Arjuna. He knew the strength of Bhéma and Arjuna, and
thus he compared the others with them.

There are personalities like yourself, Bhéñma, Karëa, Kåpa, Açvatthämä, Vikarëa
and the son of Somadatta called Bhuriçravä, who are always victorious in battle.

PURPORT
Duryodhana mentioned the exceptional heroes in the battle, all of whom are
ever-victorious. Vikarëa is the brother of Duryodhana, Açvatthämä is the son of
Droëäcärya, and Saumadatti, or Bhüriçravä, is the son of the King of the
Bählékas. Karëa is the half brother of Arjuna, as he was born of Kunté before
her marriage with King Päëòu. Kåpäcärya married the twin sister of Droëäcärya.

TRANSLATION
There are many other heroes who are prepared to lay down their lives for my
sake. All of them are well equipped with different kinds of weapons, and all are
experienced in military science.

PURPORT
As far as the others are concerned—like Jayadratha, Kåtavarmä, Çalya, etc.—all
are determined to lay down their lives for Duryodhana’s sake. In other words, it
is already concluded that all of them would die in the Battle of Kurukñetra for
joining the party of the sinful Duryodhana. Duryodhana was, of course, confident
of his victory on account of the above-mentioned combined strength of his
friends.

abhirakñitam—carefully protected.

TRANSLATION
Our strength is immeasurable, and we are perfectly protected by Grandfather
Bhéñma, whereas the strength of the Päëòavas, carefully protected by Bhéma, is
limited.

PURPORT
Herein an estimation of comparative strength is made by Duryodhana. He thinks
that the strength of his armed forces is immeasurable, being specifically
protected by the most experienced general, Grandfather Bhéñma. On the other
hand, the forces of the Päëòavas are limited, being protected by a less
experienced general, Bhéma, who is like a fig in the presence of Bhéñma.
Duryodhana was always envious of Bhéma because he knew perfectly well that if he
should die at all, he would only be killed by Bhéma. But at the same time, he
was confident of his victory on account of the presence of Bhéñma, who was a far
superior general. His conclusion that he would come out of the battle victorious
was well ascertained.


Bg 1.11

they are differently arranged; avasthitäù—situated; bhéñmam—unto Grandfather
Bhéñma; eva—certainly; abhirakñantu—support may be given; bhavantaù—all of you;
sarve—respectively; eva—certainly; hi—and exactly.

TRANSLATION
Now all of you must give full support to Grandfather Bhéñma, standing at your
respective strategic points in the phalanx of the army.

PURPORT
Duryodhana, after praising the prowess of Bhéñma, further considered that others
might think that they had been considered less important, so in his usual
diplomatic way, he tried to adjust the situation in the above words. He
emphasized that Bhéñmadeva was undoubtedly the greatest hero, but he was an old
man, so everyone must especially think of his protection from all sides. He
might become engaged in the fight, and the enemy might take advantage of his
full engagement on one side. Therefore, it was important that other heroes would
not leave their strategic positions and allow the enemy to break the phalanx.
Duryodhana clearly felt that the victory of the Kurus depended on the presence
of Bhéñmadeva. He was confident of the full support of Bhéñmadeva and Droëäcärya
in the battle because he well knew that they did not even speak a word when
Arjuna’s wife Draupadé, in her helpless condition, had appealed to them for
justice while she was being forced to strip naked in the presence of all the
great generals in the assembly. Although he knew that the two generals had some
sort of affection for the Päëòavas, he hoped that all such affection would now
be completely given up by them, as was customary during the gambling
performances.

tasya—his; saïjanayan—increasing; harñam—cheerfulness; kuru-våddhaù—the
grandsire of the Kuru dynasty (Bhéñma); pitämahaù—the grandfather;
siàha-nädam—roaring sound, like a lion; vinadya—vibrating; uccaiù—very loudly;
çaìkham—conchshell; dadhmau—blew; pratäpavän—the valiant.

TRANSLATION
Then Bhéñma, the great valiant grandsire of the Kuru dynasty, the grandfather of
the fighters, blew his conchshell very loudly like the sound of a lion, giving
Duryodhana joy.

PURPORT
The grandsire of the Kuru dynasty could understand the inner meaning of the
heart of his grandson Duryodhana, and out of his natural compassion for him he
tried to cheer him by blowing his conchshell very loudly, befitting his position
as a lion. Indirectly, by the symbolism of the conchshell, he informed his
depressed grandson Duryodhana that he had no chance of victory in the battle,
because the Supreme Lord Kåñëa was on the other side. But still, it was his duty
to conduct the fight, and no pains would be spared in that connection.

After that, the conchshells, bugles, trumpets, drums and horns were all suddenly
sounded, and the combined sound was tumultuous.

husband of the goddess of fortune); päëòavaù—Arjuna (the son of Päëòu); ca—also;
eva—certainly; divyau—transcendental; çaìkhau—conchshells; pradadhmatuù—sounded.

TRANSLATION
On the other side, both Lord Kåñëa and Arjuna, stationed on a great chariot
drawn by white horses, sounded their transcendental conchshells.

PURPORT
In contrast with the conchshell blown by Bhéñmadeva, the conchshells in the
hands of Kåñëa and Arjuna are described as transcendental. The sounding of the
transcendental conchshells indicated that there was no hope of victory for the
other side because Kåñëa was on the side of the Päëòavas. Jayas tu
päëòu-puträëäà yeñäà pakñe janärdanaù. Victory is always with persons like the
sons of Päëòu because Lord Kåñëa is associated with them. And whenever and
wherever the Lord is present, the goddess of fortune is also there because the
goddess of fortune never lives alone without her husband. Therefore, victory and
fortune were awaiting Arjuna, as indicated by the transcendental sound produced
by the conchshell of Viñëu, or Lord Kåñëa. Besides that, the chariot on which
both the friends were seated was donated by Agni (the fire-god) to Arjuna, and
this indicated that this chariot was capable of conquering all sides, wherever
it was drawn over the three worlds.

who directs the senses of the devotees); devadattam—the conchshell named
Devadatta; dhanaïjayaù—Dhanaïjaya (Arjuna, the winner of wealth); pauëòram—the
conch named Pauëòram; dadhmau—blew; mahä-çaìkham—the terrific conchshell;
bhéma-karmä—one who performs Herculean tasks; våkodaraù—the voracious eater
(Bhéma).

TRANSLATION
Then, Lord Kåñëa blew His conchshell, called Päïcajanya; Arjuna blew his, the
Devadatta; and Bhéma, the voracious eater and performer of Herculean tasks, blew
his terrific conchshell called Pauëòram.

PURPORT
Lord Kåñëa is referred to as Håñékeça in this verse because He is the owner of
all senses. The living entities are part and parcel of Him, and, therefore, the
senses of the living entities are also part and parcel of His senses. The
impersonalists cannot account for the senses of the living entities, and
therefore they are always anxious to describe all living entities as sense-less,
or impersonal. The Lord, situated in the hearts of all living entities, directs
their senses. But, He directs in terms of the surrender of the living entity,
and in the case of a pure devotee He directly controls the senses. Here on the
Battlefield of Kurukñetra the Lord directly controls the transcendental senses
of Arjuna, and thus His particular name of Håñékeça. The Lord has different
names according to His different activities. For example, His name is
Madhusüdana because He killed the demon of the name Madhu; His name is Govinda
because He gives pleasure to the cows and to the senses; His name is Väsudeva
because He appeared as the son of Vasudeva; His name is Devaké-nandana because
He accepted Devaké as His mother; His name is Yaçodä-nandana because He awarded
His childhood pastimes to Yaçodä at Våndävana; His name is Pärtha-särathi
because He worked as charioteer of His friend Arjuna. Similarly, His name is
Håñékeça because He gave direction to Arjuna on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra.

Arjuna is referred to as Dhanaïjaya in this verse because he helped his elder
brother in fetching wealth when it was required by the King to make expenditures
for different sacrifices. Similarly, Bhéma is known as Våkodara because he could
eat as voraciously as he could perform Herculean tasks, such as killing the
demon Hiòimba. So, the particular types of conchshell blown by the different
personalities on the side of the Päëòavas, beginning with the Lord’s, were all
very encouraging to the fighting soldiers. On the other side there were no such
credits, nor the presence of Lord Kåñëa, the supreme director, nor that of the
goddess of fortune. So, they were predestined to lose the battle—and that was
the message announced by the sounds of the conchshells.

King Yudhiñöhira, the son of Kunté, blew his conchshell, the Anantavijaya, and

Sätyaki, Drupada, the sons of Draupadé, and the others, O King, such as the son
of Subhadrä, greatly armed, all blew their respective conchshells.

PURPORT
Saïjaya informed King Dhåtaräñöra very tactfully that his unwise policy of
deceiving the sons of Päëòu and endeavoring to enthrone his own sons on the seat
of the kingdom was not very laudable. The signs already clearly indicated that
the whole Kuru dynasty would be killed in that great battle. Beginning with the
grandsire, Bhéñma, down to the grandsons like Abhimanyu and others—including
kings from many states of the world—all were present there, and all were doomed.
The whole catastrophe was due to King Dhåtaräñöra, because he encouraged the
policy followed by his sons.

TRANSLATION
The blowing of these different conchshells became uproarious, and thus,
vibrating both in the sky and on the earth, it shattered the hearts of the sons
of Dhåtaräñöra.

PURPORT
When Bhéñma and the others on the side of Duryodhana blew their respective
conchshells, there was no heart-breaking on the part of the Päëòavas. Such
occurrences are not mentioned, but in this particular verse it is mentioned that
the hearts of the sons of Dhåtaräñöra were shattered by the sounds vibrated by
the Päëòavas’ party. This is due to the Päëòavas and their confidence in Lord
Kåñëa. One who takes shelter of the Supreme Lord has nothing to fear, even in
the midst of the greatest calamity.

TRANSLATION
O King, at that time Arjuna, the son of Päëòu, who was seated in his chariot,
his flag marked with Hanumän, took up his bow and prepared to shoot his arrows,
looking at the sons of Dhåtaräñöra. O King, Arjuna then spoke to Håñékeça
[Kåñëa] these words:

PURPORT
The battle was just about to begin. It is understood from the above statement
that the sons of Dhåtaräñöra were more or less disheartened by the unexpected
arrangement of military force by the Päëòavas, who were guided by the direct
instructions of Lord Kåñëa on the battlefield. The emblem of Hanumän on the flag
of Arjuna is another sign of victory because Hanumän cooperated with Lord Räma
in the battle between Räma and Rävaëa, and Lord Räma emerged victorious. Now
both Räma and Hanumän were present on the chariot of Arjuna to help him. Lord
Kåñëa is Räma Himself, and wherever Lord Räma is, His eternal servitor Hanumän
and His eternal consort Sétä, the goddess of fortune, are present. Therefore,
Arjuna had no cause to fear any enemies whatsoever. And above all, the Lord of
the senses, Lord Kåñëa, was personally present to give him direction. Thus, all
good counsel was available to Arjuna in the matter of executing the battle. In
such auspicious conditions, arranged by the Lord for His eternal devotee, lay
the signs of assured victory.

TRANSLATION
Arjuna said: O infallible one, please draw my chariot between the two armies so
that I may see who is present here, who is desirous of fighting, and with whom I
must contend in this great battle attempt.

PURPORT
Although Lord Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, out of His causeless
mercy He was engaged in the service of His friend. He never fails in His
affection for His devotees, and thus He is addressed herein as infallible. As
charioteer, He had to carry out the orders of Arjuna, and since He did not
hesitate to do so, He is addressed as infallible. Although He had accepted the
position of a charioteer for His devotee, His supreme position was not
challenged. In all circumstances, He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
Håñékeça, the Lord of the total senses. The relationship between the Lord and
His servitor is very sweet and transcendental. The servitor is always ready to
render a service to the Lord, and, similarly, the Lord is always seeking an
opportunity to render some service to the devotee. He takes greater pleasure in
His pure devotee’s assuming the advantageous postion of ordering Him than He
does in being the giver of orders. As master, everyone is under His orders, and
no one is above Him to order Him. But when he finds that a pure devotee is
ordering Him, He obtains transcendental pleasure, although He is the infallible
master of all circumstances.

As a pure devotee of the Lord, Arjuna had no desire to fight with his cousins
and brothers, but he was forced to come onto the battlefield by the obstinacy of
Duryodhana, who was never agreeable to any peaceful negotiation. Therefore, he
was very anxious to see who the leading persons present on the battlefield were.
Although there was no question of a peacemaking endeavor on the battlefield, he
wanted to see them again, and to see how much they were bent upon demanding an
unwanted war.

Let me see those who have come here to fight, wishing to please the evil-minded

PURPORT
It was an open secret that Duryodhana wanted to usurp the kingdom of the
Päëòavas by evil plans, in collaboration with his father, Dhåtaräñöra.
Therefore, all persons who had joined the side of Duryodhana must have been
birds of the same feather. Arjuna wanted to see them in the battlefield before
the fight was begun, just to learn who they were, but he had no intention of
proposing peace negotiations with them. It was also a fact that he wanted to see
them to make an estimate of the strength which he had to face, although he was
quite confident of victory because Kåñëa was sitting by his side.

TRANSLATION
Saïjaya said: O descendant of Bharata, being thus addressed by Arjuna, Lord
Kåñëa drew up the fine chariot in the midst of the armies of both parties.

PURPORT
In this verse Arjuna is referred to as Guòäkeça. Guòäka means sleep, and one who
conquers sleep is called guòäkeça. Sleep also means ignorance. So Arjuna
conquered both sleep and ignorance because of his friendship with Kåñëa. As a
great devotee of Kåñëa, he could not forget Kåñëa even for a moment, because
that is the nature of a devotee. Either in waking or in sleep, a devotee of the
Lord can never be free from thinking of Kåñëa’s name, form, quality and
pastimes. Thus a devotee of Kåñëa can conquer both sleep and ignorance simply by
thinking of Kåñëa constantly. This is called Kåñëa consciousness, or samädhi. As
Håñékeça, or the director of the senses and mind of every living entity, Kåñëa
could understand Arjuna’s purpose in placing the chariot in the midst of the
armies. Thus He did so, and spoke as follows.

TRANSLATION
In the presence of Bhéñma, Droëa and all other chieftains of the world,
Håñékeça, the Lord, said, Just behold, Pärtha, all the Kurus who are assembled
here.

PURPORT
As the Supersoul of all living entities, Lord Kåñëa could understand what was
going on in the mind of Arjuna. The use of the word Håñékeça in this connection
indicates that He knew everything. And the word Pärtha, or the son of Kunté or
Påthä, is also similarly significant in reference to Arjuna. As a friend, He
wanted to inform Arjuna that because Arjuna was the son of Påthä, the sister of
His own father Vasudeva, He had agreed to be the charioteer of Arjuna. Now what
did Kåñëa mean when He told Arjuna to “behold the Kurus”? Did Arjuna want to
stop there and not fight? Kåñëa never expected such things from the son of His
aunt Påthä. The mind of Arjuna was thus predicated by the Lord in friendly
joking.

PURPORT
On the battlefield Arjuna could see all kinds of relatives. He could see persons
like Bhüriçravä, who were his father’s contemporaries, grandfathers Bhéñma and
Somadatta, teachers like Droëäcärya and Kåpäcärya, maternal uncles like Çalya
and Çakuni, brothers like Duryodhana, sons like Lakñmaëa, friends like
Açvatthämä, well-wishers like Kåtavarmä, etc. He could see also the armies which
contained many of his friends.

TRANSLATION
Arjuna said: My dear Kåñëa, seeing my friends and relatives present before me in
such a fighting spirit, I feel the limbs of my body quivering and my mouth
drying up.

PURPORT
Any man who has genuine devotion to the Lord has all the good qualities which
are found in godly persons or in the demigods, whereas the nondevotee, however
advanced he may be in material qualifications by education and culture, lacks in
godly qualities. As such, Arjuna, just after seeing his kinsmen, friends and
relatives on the battlefield, was at once overwhelmed by compassion for them who
had so decided to fight amongst themselves. As far as his soldiers were
concerned, he was sympathetic from the beginning, but he felt compassion even
for the soldiers of the opposite party, foreseeing their imminent death. And so
thinking, the limbs of his body began to quiver, and his mouth became dry. He
was more or less astonished to see their fighting spirit. Practically the whole
community, all blood relatives of Arjuna, had come to fight with him. This
overwhelmed a kind devotee like Arjuna. Although it is not mentioned here, still
one can easily imagine that not only were Arjuna’s bodily limbs quivering and
his mouth drying up, but that he was also crying out of compassion. Such
symptoms in Arjuna were not due to weakness but to his softheartedness, a
characteristic of a pure devotee of the Lord. It is said therefore:

yasyästi bhaktir bhagavaty akiïcanä
sarvair guëais tatra samäsate suräù
haräv abhaktasya kuto mahad-guëä
mano-rathenäsati dhävato bahiù

“One who has unflinching devotion for the Personality of Godhead has all the
good qualities of the demigods. But one who is not a devotee of the Lord has
only material qualifications that are of little value. This is because he is
hovering on the mental plane and is certain to be attracted by the glaring
material energy.” (Bhäg. 5.18.12)

TRANSLATION
My whole body is trembling, and my hair is standing on end. My bow Gäëòéva is
slipping from my hand, and my skin is burning.

PURPORT
There are two kinds of trembling of the body, and two kinds of standings of the
hair on end. Such phenomena occur either in great spiritual ecstasy or out of
great fear under material conditions. There is no fear in transcendental
realization. Arjuna’s symptoms in this situation are out of material
fear—namely, loss of life. This is evident from other symptoms also; he became
so impatient that his famous bow Gäëòéva was slipping from his hands, and,
because his heart was burning within him, he was feeling a burning sensation of
the skin. All these are due to a material conception of life.

TRANSLATION
I am now unable to stand here any longer. I am forgetting myself, and my mind is
reeling. I foresee only evil, O killer of the Keçé demon.

PURPORT
Due to his impatience, Arjuna was unable to stay on the battlefield, and he was
forgetting himself on account of the weakness of his mind. Excessive attachment
for material things puts a man in a bewildering condition of existence. Bhayaà
dvitéyäbhiniveçataù: such fearfulness and loss of mental equilibrium take place
in persons who are too affected by material conditions. Arjuna envisioned only
unhappiness in the battlefield—he would not be happy even by gaining victory
over the foe. The word nimitta is significant. When a man sees only frustration
in his expectations, he thinks, “Why am I here?” Everyone is interested in
himself and his own welfare. No one is interested in the Supreme Self. Arjuna is
supposed to show disregard for self-interest by submission to the will of Kåñëa,
who is everyone’s real self-interest. The conditioned soul forgets this, and
therefore suffers material pains. Arjuna thought that his victory in the battle
would only be a cause of lamentation for him.

TRANSLATION
I do not see how any good can come from killing my own kinsmen in this battle,
nor can I, my dear Kåñëa, desire any subsequent victory, kingdom, or happiness.

PURPORT
Without knowing that one’s self-interest is in Viñëu (or Kåñëa), conditioned
souls are attracted by bodily relationships, hoping to be happy in such
situations. Under delusion, they forget that Kåñëa is also the cause of material
happiness. Arjuna appears to have even forgotten the moral codes for a kñatriya.
It is said that two kinds of men, namely the kñatriya who dies directly in front
of the battlefield under Kåñëa’s personal orders and the person in the renounced
order of life who is absolutely devoted to spiritual culture, are eligible to
enter into the sun-globe, which is so powerful and dazzling. Arjuna is reluctant
even to kill his enemies, let alone his relatives. He thought that by killing
his kinsmen there would be no happiness in his life, and therefore he was not
willing to fight, just as a person who does not feel hunger is not inclined to
cook. He has now decided to go into the forest and live a secluded life in
frustration. But as a kñatriya, he requires a kingdom for his subsistence,
because the kñatriyas cannot engage themselves in any other occupation. But
Arjuna has had no kingdom. Arjuna’s sole opportunity for gaining a kingdom lay
in fighting with his cousins and brothers and reclaiming the kingdom inherited
from his father, which he does not like to do. Therefore he considers himself
fit to go to the forest to live a secluded life of frustration.

TRANSLATION
O Govinda, of what avail to us are kingdoms, happiness or even life itself when
all those for whom we may desire them are now arrayed in this battlefield? O
Madhusüdana, when teachers, fathers, sons, grandfathers, maternal uncles,
fathers-in-law, grandsons, brothers-in-law and all relatives are ready to give
up their lives and properties and are standing before me, then why should I wish
to kill them, though I may survive? O maintainer of all creatures, I am not
prepared to fight with them even in exchange for the three worlds, let alone
this earth.

PURPORT
Arjuna has addressed Lord Kåñëa as Govinda because Kåñëa is the object of all
pleasures for cows and the senses. By using this significant word, Arjuna
indicates what will satisfy his senses. Although Govinda is not meant for
satisfying our senses, if we try to satisfy the senses of Govinda then
automatically our own senses are satisfied. Materially, everyone wants to
satisfy his senses, and he wants God to be the order supplier for such
satisfaction. The Lord will satisfy the senses of the living entities as much as
they deserve, but not to the extent that they may covet. But when one takes the
opposite way—namely, when one tries to satisfy the senses of Govinda without
desiring to satisfy one’s own senses—then by the grace of Govinda all desires of
the living entity are satisfied. Arjuna’s deep affection for community and
family members is exhibited here partly due to his natural compassion for them.
He is therefore not prepared to fight. Everyone wants to show his opulence to
friends and relatives, but Arjuna fears that all his relatives and friends will
be killed in the battlefield, and he will be unable to share his opulence after
victory. This is a typical calculation of material life. The transcendental life
is, however, different. Since a devotee wants to satisfy the desires of the
Lord, he can, Lord willing, accept all kinds of opulence for the service of the
Lord, and if the Lord is not willing, he should not accept a farthing. Arjuna
did not want to kill his relatives, and if there were any need to kill them, he
desired that Kåñëa kill them personally. At this point he did not know that
Kåñëa had already killed them before their coming into the battlefield and that
he was only to become an instrument for Kåñëa. This fact is disclosed in
following chapters. As a natural devotee of the Lord, Arjuna did not like to
retaliate against his miscreant cousins and brothers, but it was the Lord’s plan
that they should all be killed. The devotee of the Lord does not retaliate
against the wrongdoer, but the Lord does not tolerate any mischief done to the
devotee by the miscreants. The Lord can excuse a person on His own account, but
He excuses no one who has done harm to His devotees. Therefore the Lord was
determined to kill the miscreants, although Arjuna wanted to excuse them.

TRANSLATION
Sin will overcome us if we slay such aggressors. Therefore it is not proper for
us to kill the sons of Dhåtaräñöra and our friends. What should we gain, O
Kåñëa, husband of the goddess of fortune, and how could we be happy by killing
our own kinsmen?

PURPORT
According to Vedic injunctions there are six kinds of aggressors: 1) a poison
giver, 2) one who sets fire to the house, 3) one who attacks with deadly
weapons, 4) one who plunders riches, 5) one who occupies another’s land, and 6)
one who kidnaps a wife. Such aggressors are at once to be killed, and no sin is
incurred by killing such aggressors. Such killing of aggressors is quite
befitting for any ordinary man, but Arjuna was not an ordinary person. He was
saintly by character, and therefore he wanted to deal with them in saintliness.
This kind of saintliness, however, is not for a kñatriya. Although a responsible
man in the administration of a state is required to be saintly, he should not be
cowardly. For example, Lord Räma was so saintly that people were anxious to live
in His kingdom, (Räma-räjya), but Lord Räma never showed any cowardice. Rävaëa
was an aggressor against Räma because he kidnapped Räma’s wife, Sétä, but Lord
Räma gave him sufficient lessons, unparalleled in the history of the world. In
Arjuna’s case, however, one should consider the special type of aggressors,
namely his own grandfather, own teacher, friends, sons, grandsons, etc. Because
of them, Arjuna thought that he should not take the severe steps necessary
against ordinary aggressors. Besides that, saintly persons are advised to
forgive. Such injunctions for saintly persons are more important than any
political emergency. Arjuna considered that rather than kill his own kinsmen for
political reasons, it would be better to forgive them on grounds of religion and
saintly behavior. He did not, therefore, consider such killing profitable simply
for the matter of temporary bodily happiness. After all, kingdoms and pleasures
derived therefrom are not permanent, so why should he risk his life and eternal
salvation by killing his own kinsmen? Arjuna’s addressing of Kåñëa as “Mädhava,”
or the husband of the goddess of fortune, is also significant in this
connection. He wanted to point out to Kåñëa that, as husband of the goddess of
fortune, He should not have to induce Arjuna to take up a matter which would
ultimately bring about misfortune. Kåñëa, however, never brings misfortune to
anyone, to say nothing of His devotees.

O Janärdana, although these men, overtaken by greed, see no fault in killing
one’s family or quarreling with friends, why should we, with knowledge of the
sin, engage in these acts?

PURPORT
A kñatriya is not supposed to refuse to battle or gamble when he is so invited
by some rival party. Under such obligation, Arjuna could not refuse to fight
because he was challenged by the party of Duryodhana. In this connection, Arjuna
considered that the other party might be blind to the effects of such a
challenge. Arjuna, however, could see the evil consequences and could not accept
the challenge. Obligation is actually binding when the effect is good, but when
the effect is otherwise, then no one can be bound. Considering all these pros
and cons, Arjuna decided not to fight.

TRANSLATION
With the destruction of dynasty, the eternal family tradition is vanquished, and
thus the rest of the family becomes involved in irreligious practice.

PURPORT
In the system of the varëäçrama institution there are many principles of
religious traditions to help members of the family grow properly and attain
spiritual values. The elder members are responsible for such purifying processes
in the family, beginning from birth to death. But on the death of the elder
members, such family traditions of purification may stop, and the remaining
younger family members may develop irreligious habits and thereby lose their
chance for spiritual salvation. Therefore, for no purpose should the elder
members of the family be slain.

become corrupt, and from the degradation of womanhood, O descendant of Våñëi,
comes unwanted progeny.

PURPORT
Good population in human society is the basic principle for peace, prosperity
and spiritual progress in life. The varëäçrama religion’s principles were so
designed that the good population would prevail in society for the general
spiritual progress of state and community. Such population depends on the
chastity and faithfulness of its womanhood. As children are very prone to be
misled, women are similarly very prone to degradation. Therefore, both children
and women require protection by the elder members of the family. By being
engaged in various religious practices, women will not be misled into adultery.
According to Cäëakya Paëòit, women are generally not very intelligent and
therefore not trustworthy. So, the different family traditions of religious
activities should always engage them, and thus their chastity and devotion will
give birth to a good population eligible for participating in the varëäçrama
system. On the failure of such varëäçrama-dharma, naturally the women become
free to act and mix with men, and thus adultery is indulged in at the risk of
unwanted population. Irresponsible men also provoke adultery in society, and
thus unwanted children flood the human race at the risk of war and pestilence.

lupta—stopped; piëòa—offerings; udaka—water; kriyäù—performance.

TRANSLATION
When there is increase of unwanted population, a hellish situation is created
both for the family and for those who destroy the family tradition. In such
corrupt families, there is no offering of oblations of food and water to the
ancestors.

PURPORT
According to the rules and regulations of fruitive activities, there is a need
to offer periodical food and water to the forefathers of the family. This
offering is performed by worship of Viñëu, because eating the remnants of food
offered to Viñëu can deliver one from all kinds of sinful actions. Sometimes the
forefathers may be suffering from various types of sinful reactions, and
sometimes some of them cannot even acquire a gross material body and are forced
to remain in subtle bodies as ghosts. Thus, when remnants of prasädam food are
offered to forefathers by descendants, the forefathers are released from ghostly
or other kinds of miserable life. Such help rendered to forefathers is a family
tradition, and those who are not in devotional life are required to perform such
rituals. One who is engaged in the devotional life is not required to perform
such actions. Simply by performing devotional service, one can deliver hundreds
and thousands of forefathers from all kinds of misery. It is stated in the
Bhägavatam:

devarñi-bhütäpta-nånäà pitèëäà
na kiìkaro näyamåëé ca räjan
sarvätmanä yaù çaraëaà çaraëyaà
gato mukundaà parihåtya kartam

“Anyone who has taken shelter of the lotus feet of Mukunda, the giver of
liberation, giving up all kinds of obligation, and has taken to the path in all
seriousness, owes neither duties nor obligations to the demigods, sages, general
living entities, family members, humankind or forefathers.” (Bhäg. 11.5.41) Such
obligations are automatically fulfilled by performance of devotional service to
the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

TRANSLATION
Due to the evil deeds of the destroyers of family tradition, all kinds of
community projects and family welfare activities are devastated.

PURPORT
The four orders of human society, combined with family welfare activities as
they are set forth by the institution of the sanätana-dharma or
varëäçrama-dharma, are designed to enable the human being to attain his ultimate
salvation. Therefore, the breaking of the sanätana-dharma tradition by
irresponsible leaders of society brings about chaos in that society, and
consequently people forget the aim of life—Viñëu. Such leaders are called blind,
and persons who follow such leaders are sure to be led into chaos.

TRANSLATION
O Kåñëa, maintainer of the people, I have heard by disciplic succession that
those who destroy family traditions dwell always in hell.

PURPORT
Arjuna bases his argument not on his own personal experience, but on what he has
heard from the authorities. That is the way of receiving real knowledge. One
cannot reach the real point of factual knowledge without being helped by the
right person who is already established in that knowledge. There is a system in
the varëäçrama institution by which one has to undergo the process of ablution
before death for his sinful activities. One who is always engaged in sinful
activities must utilize the process of ablution called the präyaçcitta. Without
doing so, one surely will be transferred to hellish planets to undergo miserable
lives as the result of sinful activities.

TRANSLATION
Alas, how strange it is that we are preparing to commit greatly sinful acts,
driven by the desire to enjoy royal happiness.

PURPORT
Driven by selfish motives, one may be inclined to such sinful acts as the
killing of one’s own brother, father, or mother. There are many such instances
in the history of the world. But Arjuna, being a saintly devotee of the Lord, is
always conscious of moral principles and therefore takes care to avoid such
activities.

TRANSLATION
I would consider it better for the sons of Dhåtaräñöra to kill me unarmed and
unresisting, rather than fight with them.

PURPORT
It is the custom—according to kñatriya fighting principles—that an unarmed and
unwilling foe should not be attacked. Arjuna, however, in such an enigmatic
position, decided he would not fight if he were attacked by the enemy. He did
not consider how much the other party was bent upon fighting. All these symptoms
are due to softheartedness resulting from his being a great devotee of the Lord.

TRANSLATION
Saïjaya said: Arjuna, having thus spoken on the battlefield, cast aside his bow
and arrows and sat down on the chariot, his mind overwhelmed with grief.

PURPORT
While observing the situation of his enemy, Arjuna stood up on the chariot, but
he was so afflicted with lamentation that he sat down again, setting aside his
bow and arrows. Such a kind and softhearted person, in the devotional service of
the Lord, is fit to receive self-knowledge.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the First Chapter of the
Çrémad-Bhagavad-gétä in the matter of Observing the Armies on the Battlefield of
Kurukñetra.

killer of Madhu.

TRANSLATION
Saïjaya said: Seeing Arjuna full of compassion and very sorrowful, his eyes
brimming with tears, Madhusüdana, Kåñëa, spoke the following words.

PURPORT
Material compassion, lamentation and tears are all signs of ignorance of the
real self. Compassion for the eternal soul is self-realization. The word
“Madhusüdana” is significant in this verse. Lord Kåñëa killed the demon Madhu,
and now Arjuna wanted Kåñëa to kill the demon of misunderstanding that had
overtaken him in the discharge of his duty. No one knows where compassion should
be applied. Compassion for the dress of a drowning man is senseless. A man
fallen in the ocean of nescience cannot be saved simply by rescuing his outward
dress—the gross material body. One who does not know this and laments for the
outward dress is called a çüdra, or one who laments unnecessarily. Arjuna was a
kñatriya, and this conduct was not expected from him. Lord Kåñëa, however, can
dissipate the lamentation of the ignorant man, and for this purpose the
Bhagavad-gétä was sung by Him. This chapter instructs us in self-realization by
an analytical study of the material body and the spirit soul, as explained by
the supreme authority, Lord Çré Kåñëa. This realization is made possible by
working with the fruitive being situated in the fixed conception of the real
self.

crisis; samupasthitam—arrived; anärya—persons who do not know the value of life;
juñöam—practiced by; asvargyam—that which does not lead to higher planets;
akérti—infamy; karam—the cause of; arjuna—O Arjuna.

TRANSLATION
The Supreme Person [Bhagavän] said: My dear Arjuna, how have these impurities
come upon you? They are not at all befitting a man who knows the progressive
values of life. They do not lead to higher planets, but to infamy.

PURPORT
Kåñëa and the Supreme Personality of Godhead are identical. Therefore Lord Kåñëa
is referred to as “Bhagavän” throughout the Gétä. Bhagavän is the ultimate in
the Absolute Truth. Absolute Truth is realized in three phases of understanding,
namely Brahman or the impersonal all-pervasive spirit; Paramätmä, or the
localized aspect of the Supreme within the heart of all living entities; and
Bhagavän, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Kåñëa. In the
Çrémad-Bhägavatam this conception of the Absolute Truth is explained thus:

vadanti tat tattva-vidas tattvaà yaj jïänam advayam
brahmeti paramätmeti bhagavän iti çabdyate.

“The Absolute Truth is realized in three phases of understanding by the knower
of the Absolute Truth, and all of them are identical. Such phases of the
Absolute Truth are expressed as Brahman, Paramätmä, and Bhagavän.” (Bhäg.
1.2.11) These three divine aspects can be explained by the example of the sun,
which also has three different aspects, namely the sunshine, the sun’s surface
and the sun planet itself. One who studies the sunshine only is the preliminary
student. One who understands the sun’s surface is further advanced. And one who
can enter into the sun planet is the highest. Ordinary students who are
satisfied by simply understanding the sunshine—its universal pervasiveness and
the glaring effulgence of its impersonal nature—may be compared to those who can
realize only the Brahman feature of the Absolute Truth. The student who has
advanced still further can know the sun disc, which is compared to knowledge of
the Paramätmä feature of the Absolute Truth. And the student who can enter into
the heart of the sun planet is compared to those who realize the personal
features of the Supreme Absolute Truth. Therefore, the bhaktas, or the
transcendentalists who have realized the Bhagavän feature of the Absolute Truth,
are the topmost transcendentalists, although all students who are engaged in the
study of the Absolute Truth are engaged in the same subject matter. The
sunshine, the sun disc and the inner affairs of the sun planet cannot be
separated from one another, and yet the students of the three different phases
are not in the same category.

The Sanskrit word Bhagavän is explained by the great authority, Paräçara Muni,
the father of Vyäsadeva. The Supreme Personality who possesses all riches, all
strength, all fame, all beauty, all knowledge and all renunciation is called
Bhagavän. There are many persons who are very rich, very powerful, very
beautiful, very famous, very learned, and very much detached, but no one can
claim that he possesses all riches, all strength, etc., entirely. Only Kåñëa can
claim this because He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. No living entity,
including Brahmä, Lord Çiva, or Näräyaëa, can possess opulences as fully as
Kåñëa. Therefore it is concluded in the Brahma-saàhitä by Lord Brahmä himself
that Lord Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. No one is equal to or
above Him. He is the primeval Lord, or Bhagavän, known as Govinda, and He is the
supreme cause of all causes.

éçvaraù paramaù kåñëaù sac-cid-änanda-vigrahaù
anädir ädir govindaù sarua-käraëa-käraëam

“There are many personalities possessing the qualities of Bhagavän, but Kåñëa is
the supreme because none can excel Him. He is the Supreme Person, and His body
is eternal, full of knowledge and bliss. He is the primeval Lord Govinda and the
cause of all causes.” (Brahma-saàhitä 5.1)

In the Bhägavatam also there is a list of many incarnations of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, but Kåñëa is described as the original Personality of
Godhead, from whom many, many incarnations and Personalities of Godhead expand:

ete cäàça-kaläù puàsaù kåñëas tu bhagavän svayam
indräri-vyäkulaà lokaà måòayanti yuge yuge

“All the lists of the incarnations of Godhead submitted herewith are either
plenary expansions or parts of the plenary expansions of the Supreme Godhead,
but Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself.” (Bhag. 1.3.28)

Therefore, Kåñëa is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute
Truth, the source of both the Supersoul and the impersonal Brahman.

In the presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Arjuna’s lamentation for
his kinsmen is certainly unbecoming, and therefore Kåñëa expressed His surprise
with the word kutas, “wherefrom.” Such unmanly sentiments were never expected
from a person belonging to the civilized class of men known as Äryans. The word
äryan is applicable to persons who know the value of life and have a
civilization based on spiritual realization. Persons who are led by the material
conception of life do not know that the aim of life is realization of the
Absolute Truth, Viñëu, or Bhagavän, and they are captivated by the external
features of the material world, and therefore they do not know what liberation
is. Persons who have no knowledge of liberation from material bondage are called
non-Äryans. Although Arjuna was a kñatriya, he was deviating from his prescribed
duties by declining to fight. This act of cowardice is described as befitting
the non-Äryans. Such deviation from duty does not help one in the progress of
spiritual life, nor does it even give one the opportunity to become famous in
this world. Lord Kåñëa did not approve of the so-called compassion of Arjuna for
his kinsmen.

TRANSLATION
O son of Påthä, do not yield to this degrading impotence. It does not become
you. Give up such petty weakness of heart and arise, O chastiser of the enemy.

PURPORT
Arjuna was addressed as the “son of Påthä,” who happened to be the sister of
Kåñëa’s father Vasudeva. Therefore Arjuna had a blood relationship with Kåñëa.
If the son of a ksatriya declines to fight, he is a kñatriya in name only, and
if the son of a brähmaëa acts impiously, he is a brähmaëa in name only. Such
kñatriyas and brähmaëas are unworthy sons of their fathers; therefore, Kåñëa did
not want Arjuna to become an unworthy son of a kñatriya. Arjuna was the most
intimate friend of Kåñëa, and Kåñëa was directly guiding him on the chariot; but
in spite of all these credits, if Arjuna abandoned the battle, he would be
committing an infamous act; therefore Kåñëa said that such an attitude in Arjuna
did not fit his personality. Arjuna might argue that he would give up the battle
on the grounds of his magnanimous attitude for the most respectable Bhéñma and
his relatives, but Kåñëa considered that sort of magnanimity not approved by
authority. Therefore, such magnanimity or so-called nonviolence should be given
up by persons like Arjuna under the direct guidance of Kåñëa.

TRANSLATION
Arjuna said: O killer of Madhu [Kåñëa], how can I counterattack with arrows in
battle men like Bhéñma and Droëa, who are worthy of my worship?

PURPORT
Respectable superiors like Bhéñma the grandfather and Droëäcärya the teacher are
always worshipable. Even if they attack, they should not be counterattacked. It
is general etiquette that superiors are not to be offered even a verbal fight.
Even if they are sometimes harsh in behavior, they should not be harshly
treated. Then, how is it possible for Arjuna to counterattack them? Would Kåñëa
ever attack His own grandfather, Ugrasena, or His teacher, Sändépani Muni? These
were some of the arguments by Arjuna to Kåñëa.


TEXT 5

TRANSLATION
It is better to live in this world by begging than to live at the cost of the
lives of great souls who are my teachers. Even though they are avaricious, they
are nonetheless superiors. If they are killed, our spoils will be tainted with
blood.

PURPORT
According to scriptural codes, a teacher who engages in an abominable action and
has lost his sense of discrimination is fit to be abandoned. Bhéñma and Droëa
were obliged to take the side of Duryodhana because of his financial assistance,
although they should not have accepted such a position simply on financial
considerations. Under the circumstances, they have lost the respectability of
teachers. But Arjuna thinks that nevertheless they remain his superiors, and
therefore to enjoy material profits after killing them would mean to enjoy
spoils tainted with blood.

TRANSLATION
Nor do we know which is better—conquering them or being conquered by them. The
sons of Dhåtaräñöra, whom if we killed we should not care to live, are now
standing before us on this battlefield.

PURPORT
Arjuna did not know whether he should fight and risk unnecessary violence,
although fighting is the duty of the kñatriyas, or whether he should refrain and
live by begging. If he did not conquer the enemy, begging would be his only
means of subsistence. Nor was there certainty of victory, because either side
might emerge victorious. Even if victory awaited them (and their cause was
justified), still, if the sons of Dhåtaräñöra died in battle, it would be very
difficult to live in their absence. Under the circumstances, that would be
another kind of defeat for them. All these considerations by Arjuna definitely
prove that he was not only a great devotee of the Lord but that he was also
highly enlightened and had complete control over his mind and senses. His desire
to live by begging, although he was born in the royal household, is another sign
of detachment. He was truly virtuous, as these qualities, combined with his
faith in the words of instruction of Çré Kåñëa (his spiritual master), indicate.
It is concluded that Arjuna was quite fit for liberation. Unless the senses are
controlled, there is no chance of elevation to the platform of knowledge, and
without knowledge and devotion there is no chance of liberation. Arjuna was
competent in all these attributes, over and above his enormous attributes in his
material relationships.

Now I am confused about my duty and have lost all composure because of weakness.
In this condition I am asking You to tell me clearly what is best for me. Now I

PURPORT
By nature’s own way the complete system of material activities is a source of
perplexity for everyone. In every step there is perplexity, and therefore it
behooves one to approach a bona fide spiritual master who can give one proper
guidance for executing the purpose of life. All Vedic literatures advise us to
approach a bona fide spiritual master to get free from the perplexities of life
which happen without our desire. They are like a forest fire that somehow blazes
without being set by anyone. Similarly, the world situation is such that
perplexities of life automatically appear, without our wanting such confusion.
No one wants fire, and yet it takes place, and we become perplexed. The Vedic
wisdom therefore advises that in order to solve the perplexities of life and to
understand the science of the solution, one must approach a spiritual master who
is in the disciplic succession. A person with a bona fide spiritual master is
supposed to know everything. One should not, therefore, remain in material
perplexities but should approach a spiritual master. This is the purport of this
verse.

Who is the man in material perplexities? It is he who does not understand the
problems of life. In the Garga Upaniñad the perplexed man is described as
follows:

yo vä etad akñaraà gärgy aviditväsmäl lokät praiti sa kåpaëaù

“He is a miserly man who does not solve the problems of life as a human and who
thus quits this world like the cats and dogs, without understanding the science
of self-realization.” This human form of life is a most valuable asset for the
living entity who can ultilize it for solving the problems of life; therefore,
one who does not utilize this opportunity properly is a miser. On the other
hand, there is the brähmaëa, or he who is intelligent enough to utilize this
body to solve all the problems of life.

The kåpaëas, or miserly persons, waste their time in being overly affectionate
for family, society, country, etc., in the material conception of life. One is
often attached to family life, namely to wife, children and other members, on
the basis of “skin disease.” The kåpaëa thinks that he is able to protect his
family members from death; or the kåpaëa thinks that his family or society can
save him from the verge of death. Such family attachment can be found even in
the lower animals who take care of children also. Being intelligent, Arjuna
could understand that his affection for family members and his wish to protect
them from death were the causes ot his perplexities. Although he could
understand that his duty to fight was awaiting him, still, on account of miserly
weakness, he could not discharge the duties. He is therefore asking Lord Kåñëa,
the supreme spiritual master, to make a definite solution. He offers himself to
Kåñëa as a disciple. He wants to stop friendly talks. Talks between the master
and the disciple are serious, and now Arjuna wants to talk very seriously before
the recognized spiritual master. Kåñëa is therefore the original spiritual
master of the science of Bhagavad-gétä, and Arjuna is the first disciple for
understanding the Gétä. How Arjuna understands the Bhagavad-gétä is stated in
the Gétä itself. And yet foolish mundane scholars explain that one need not
submit to Kåñëa as a person, but to “the unborn within Kåñëa.” There is no
difference between Kåñëa’s within and without. And one who has no sense of this
understanding is the greatest fool in trying to understand Bhagavad-gétä.

TRANSLATION
I can find no means to drive away this grief which is drying up my senses. I
will not be able to destroy it even if I win an unrivalled kingdom on the earth
with sovereignty like the demigods in heaven.

PURPORT
Although Arjuna was putting forward so many arguments based on knowledge of the
principles of religion and moral codes, it appears that he was unable to solve
his real problem without the help of the spiritual master, Lord Çré Kåñëa. He
could understand that his so-called knowledge was useless in driving away his
problems, which were drying up his whole existence; and it was impossible for
him to solve such perplexities without the help of a spiritual master like Lord
Kåñëa. Academic knowledge, scholarship, high position, etc., are all useless in
solving the problems of life; help can only be given by a spiritual master like
Kåñëa. Therefore, the conclusion is that a spiritual master who is one hundred
percent Kåñëa conscious is the bona fide spiritual master, for he can solve the
problems of life. Lord Caitanya said that one who is master in the science of
Kåñëa consciousness, regardless of his social position, is the real spiritual
master.

kibävipra, kibä nyäsé, çüdra kene naya
yei kåñëa-tattva-vettä, sei ‘guru’ haya.

(Caitanya-caritämåta, Madhya 8.128)

“It does not matter whether a person is a vipra [learned scholar in Vedic
wisdom] or is born in a lower family, or is in the renounced order of life—if he
is master in the science of Kåñëa, he is the perfect and bona fide spiritual
master.” So without being a master in the science of Kåñëa consciousness, no one
is a bona fide spiritual master. It is also said in Vedic literatures:

ñaö-karma-nipuëo vipro mantra-tantra-viçäradaù
avaiñëavo gurur na syäd vaiñëavaù çvapaco guruù

“A scholarly brähmaëa, expert in all subjects of Vedic knowledge, is unfit to
become a spiritual master without being a Vaiñëava, or expert in the science of
Kåñëa consciousness. But a person born in a family of a lower caste can become a
spiritual master if he is a Vaiñëava, or Kåñëa conscious.”

The problems of material existence—birth, old age, disease and death—cannot be
counteracted by accumulation of wealth and economic development. In many parts
of the world there are states which are replete with all facilities of life,
which are full of wealth, and economically developed, yet the problems of
material existence are still present. They are seeking peace in different ways,
but they ean achieve real happiness only if they consult Kåñëa, or the
Bhagavad-gétä and Çrémad-Bhägavatam—which constitute the science of Kåñëa—or the
bona fide representative of Kåñëa, the man in Kåñëa consciousness.

If economic development and material comforts could drive away one’s
lamentations for family, social, national or international inebrieties, then
Arjuna would not have said that even an unrivalled kingdom on earth or supremacy
like that of the demigods in the heavenly planets would not be able to drive
away his lamentations. He sought, therefore, refuge in Kåñëa consciousness, and
that is the right path for peace and harmony. Economic development or supremacy
over the world can be finished at any moment by the cataclysms of material
nature. Even elevation into a higher planetary situation, as men are now seeking
a place on the moon planet, can also be finished at one stroke. The
Bhagavad-gétä confirms this: kñéëe puëye martyalokaà viçanti “When the results
of pious activities are finished, one falls down again from the peak of
happiness to the lowest status of life.” Many politicians of the world have
fallen down in that way. Such downfalls only constitute more causes for
lamentation.

Therefore, if we want to curb lamentation for good, then we have to take shelter
of Kåñëa, as Arjuna is seeking to do. So Arjuna asked Kåñëa to solve his problem
definitely, and that is the way of Kåñëa consciousness.

the master of the senses; guòäkeçaù—Arjuna, the master at curbing ignorance;

TRANSLATION
Saïjaya said: Having spoken thus, Arjuna, chastiser of enemies, told Kåñëa,
“Govinda, I shall not fight,” and fell silent.

PURPORT
Dhåtaräñöra must have been very glad to understand that Arjuna was not going to
fight and was instead leaving the battlefield for the begging profession. But
Saïjaya disappointed him again in relating that Arjuna was competent to kill his
enemies (parantapaù). Although Arjuna was for the time being overwhelmed with
false grief due to family affection, he surrendered unto Kåñëa, the supreme
spiritual master, as a disciple. This indicated that he would soon be free from
the false lamentation resulting from family affection and would be enlightened
with perfect knowledge of self-realization, or Kåñëa consciousness, and would
then surely fight. Thus Dhåtaräñöra’s joy would be frustrated, since Arjuna
would be enlightened. by Kåñëa and would fight to the end.

TRANSLATION
O descendant of Bharata, at that time Kåñëa, smiling, in the midst of both the
armies, spoke the following words to the grief-stricken Arjuna.

PURPORT
The talk was going on between intimate friends, namely the Håñékeça and the
Guòäkeça. As friends, both of them were on the same level, but one of them
voluntarily became a student of the other. Kåñëa was smiling because a friend
had chosen to become a disciple. As Lord of all, He is always in the superior
position as the master of everyone, and yet the Lord accepts one who wishes to
be a friend, a son, a lover or a devotee, or who wants Him in such a role. But
when He was accepted as the master, He at once assumed the role and talked with
the disciple like the master—with gravity, as it is required. It appears that
the talk between the master and the disciple was openly exchanged in the
presence of both armies so that all were benefitted. So the talks of
Bhagavad-gétä are not for any particular person, society, or community, but they
are for all, and friends or enemies are equally entitled to hear them.

TRANSLATION
The Blessed Lord said: While speaking learned words, you are mourning for what
is not worthy of grief. Those who are wise lament neither for the living nor the
dead.

PURPORT
The Lord at once took the position of the teacher and chastised the student,
calling him, indirectly, a fool. The Lord said, you are talking like a learned
man, but you do not know that one who is learned—one who knows what is body and
what is soul—does not lament for any stage of the body, neither in the living
nor in the dead condition. As it will be explained in later chapters, it will be
clear that knowledge means to know matter and spirit and the controller of both.
Arjuna argued that religious principles should be given more importance than
politics or sociology, but he did not know that knowledge of matter, soul and
the Supreme is even more important than religious formularies. And, because he
was lacking in that knowledge, he should not have posed himself as a very
learned man. As he did not happen to be a very learned man, he was consequently
lamenting for something which was unworthy of lamentation. The body is born and
is destined to be vanquished today or tomorrow; therefore the body is not as
important as the soul. One who knows this is actually learned, and for him there
is no cause for lamentation, regardless of the condition of the material body.

PURPORT
In the Vedas, in the Kaöha Upaniñad as well as in the Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad, it
is said that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the maintainer of innumerable
living entities, in terms of their different situations according to individual
work and reaction of work. That Supreme Personality of Godhead is also, by His
plenary portions, alive in the heart of every living entity. Only saintly
persons who can see, within and without, the same Supreme Lord, can actually
attain to perfect and eternal peace.

nityo nityänäà cetanaç cetanänäm
eko bahünäà yo vidadhäti kämän
tam ätmasthaà ye ’nupaçyanti dhéräs
teñäà çäntiù çäçvaté netareñäm.

(Kaöha 2.2.13)

The same Vedic truth given to Arjuna is given to all persons in the world who
pose themselves as very learned but factually have but a poor fund of knowledge.
The Lord says clearly that He Himself, Arjuna, and all the kings who are
assembled on the battlefield, are eternally individual beings and that the Lord
is eternally the maintainer of the individual living entities both in their
conditioned as well as in their liberated situations. The Supreme Personality of
Godhead is the supreme individual person, and Arjuna, the Lord’s eternal
associate, and all the kings assembled there are individual, eternal persons. It
is not that they did not exist as individuals in the past, and it is not that
they will not remain eternal persons. Their individuality existed in the past,
and their individuality will continue in the future without interruption.
Therefore, there is no cause for lamentation for anyone.

The Mäyävädé theory that after liberation the individual soul, separated by the
covering of mäyä or illusion, will merge into the impersonal Brahman and lose
its individual existence is not supported herein by Lord Kåñëa, the supreme
authority. Nor is the theory that we only think of individuality in the
conditioned state supported herein. Kåñëa clearly says herein that in the future
also the individuality of the Lord and others, as it is confirmed in the
Upaniñads, will continue eternally. This statement of Kåñëa is authoritative
because Kåñëa cannot be subject to illusion. If individuality is not a fact,
then Kåñëa would not have stressed it so much—even for the future. The Mäyävädé
may argue that the individuality spoken of by Kåñëa is not spiritual, but
material. Even accepting the argument that the individuality is material, then
how can one distinguish Kåñëa’s individuality? Kåñëa affirms His individuality
in the past and confirms His individuality in the future also. He has confirmed
His individuality in many ways, and impersonal Brahman has been declared to be
subordinate to Him. Kåñëa has maintained spiritual individuality all along; if
He is accepted as an ordinary conditioned soul in individual consciousness, then
His Bhagavad-gétä has no value as authoritative scripture. A common man with all
the four defects of human frailty is unable to teach that which is worth
hearing. The Gétä is above such literature. No mundane book compares with the
Bhagavad-gétä. When one accepts Kåñëa as an ordinary man, the Gétä loses all
importance. The Mäyävädé argues that the plurality mentioned in this verse is
conventional and that it refers to the body. But previous to this verse such a
bodily conception is already condemned. After condemning the bodily conception
of the living entities, how was it possible for Kåñëa to place a conventional
proposition on the body again? Therefore, individuality is maintained on
spiritual grounds and is thus confirmed by great äcäryas like Çré Rämänuja and
others. It is clearly mentioned in many places in the Gétä that this spiritual
individuality is understood by those who are devotees of the Lord. Those who are
envious of Kåñëa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead have no bona fide access
to the great literature. The nondevotee’s approach to the teachings of the Géta
is something like bees licking on a bottle of honey. One cannot have a taste of
honey unless one opens the bottle. Similarly, the mysticism of the Bhagavad-gétä
can be understood only by devotees, and no one else can taste it, as it is
stated in the Fourth Chapter of the book. Nor can the Gétä be touched by persons
who envy the very existence of the Lord. Therefore, the Mäyävädé explanation of
the Gétä is a most misleading presentation of the whole truth. Lord Caitanya has
forbidden us to read commentations made by the Mäyävädés and warns that one who
takes to such an understanding of the Mäyävädé philosophy loses all power to
understand the real mystery of the Gétä. If individuality refers to the
empirical universe, then there is no need of teaching by the Lord. The plurality
of the individual soul and of the Lord is an eternal fact, and it is confirmed
by the Vedas as above mentioned.

TRANSLATION
As the embodied soul continually passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to
old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death. The self-realized
soul is not bewildered by such a change.

PURPORT
Since every living entity is an individual soul, each is changing his body every
moment, manifesting sometimes as a child, sometimes as a youth, and sometimes as
an old man. Yet the same spirit soul is there and does not undergo any change.
This individual soul finally changes the body at death and transmigrates to
another body; and since it is sure to have another body in the next birth—either
material or spiritual—there was no cause for lamentation by Arjuna on account of
death, neither for Bhéñma nor for Droëa, for whom he was so much concerned.
Rather, he should rejoice for their changing bodies from old to new ones,
thereby rejuvenating their energy. Such changes of body account for varieties of
enjoyment or suffering, according to one’s work in life. So Bhéñma and Droëa,
being noble souls, were surely going to have either spiritual bodies in the next
life, or at least life in heavenly bodies for superior enjoyment of material
existence. So, in either case, there was no cause of lamentation.

Any man who has perfect knowledge of the constitution of the individual soul,
the Supersoul, and nature—both material and spiritual—is called a dhéra or a
most sober man. Such a man is never deluded by the change of bodies. The
Mäyävädé theory of oneness of the spirit soul cannot be entertained on the
ground that spirit soul cannot be cut into pieces as a fragmental portion. Such
cutting into different individual souls would make the Supreme cleavable or
changeable, against the principle of the Supreme Soul being unchangeable.

As confirmed in the Gétä, the fragmental portions of the Supreme exist eternally
(sanätana) and are called kñara; that is, they have a tendency to fall down into
material nature. These fragmental portions are eternally so, and even after
liberation, the individual soul remains the same—fragmental. But once liberated,
he lives an eternal life in bliss and knowledge with the Personality of Godhead.
The theory of reflection can be applied to the Supersoul who is present in each
and every individual body and is known as the Paramätmä, who is different from
the individual living entity. When the sky is reflected in water, the
reflections represent both the sun and the moon and the stars also. The stars
can be compared to the living entities and the sun or the moon to the Supreme
Lord. The individual fragmental spirit soul is represented by Arjuna, and the
Supreme Soul is the Personality of Godhead Çré Kåñëa. They are not on the same
level, as it will be apparent in the beginning of the Fourth Chapter. If Arjuna
is on the same level with Kåñëa, and Kåñëa is not superior to Arjuna, then their
relationship of instructor and instructed becomes meaningless. If both of them
are deluded by the illusory energy (mäyä), then there is no need of one being
the instructor and the other the instructed. Such instruction would be useless
because, in the clutches of mäyä, no one can be an authoritative instructor.
Under the circumstances, it is admitted that Lord Kåñëa is the Supreme Lord,
superior in position to the living entity, Arjuna, who is a forgotten soul
deluded by mäyä.

TRANSLATION
O son of Kunté, the nonpermanent appearance of happiness and distress, and their
disappearance in due course, are like the appearance and disappearance of winter
and summer seasons. They arise from sense perception, O scion of Bharata, and
one must learn to tolerate them without being disturbed.

PURPORT
In the proper discharge of duty, one has to learn to tolerate nonpermanent
appearances and disappearances of happiness and distress. According to Vedic
injunction, one has to take his bath early in the morning even during the month
of Mägha (January-February). It is very cold at that time, but in spite of that
a man who abides by the religious principles does not hesitate to take his bath.
Similarly, a woman does not hesitate to cook in the kitchen in the months of May
and June, the hottest part of the summer season. One has to execute his duty in
spite of climatic inconveniences. Similarly, to fight is the religious principle
of the kñatriyas, and although one has to fight with some friend or relative,
one should not deviate from his prescribed duty. One has to follow the
prescribed rules and regulations of religious principles in order to rise up to
the platform of knowledge because by knowledge and devotion only can one
liberate himself from the clutches of mäyä (illusion).

The two different names of address given to Arjuna are also significant. To
address him as Kaunteya signifies his great blood relations from his mother’s
side; and to address him as Bhärata signifies his greatness from his father’s
side. From both sides he is supposed to have a great heritage. A great heritage
brings responsibility in the matter of proper discharge of duties; therefore, he
cannot avoid fighting.

TRANSLATION
O best among men [Arjuna], the person who is not disturbed by happiness and
distress and is steady in both is certainly eligible for liberation.

PURPORT
Anyone who is steady in his determination for the advanced stage of spiritual
realization and can equally tolerate the onslaughts of distress and happiness is
certainly a person eligible for liberation. In the varëäçrama institution, the
fourth stage of life, namely the renounced order (sannyäsa) is a painstaking
situation. But one who is serious about making his life perfect surely adopts
the sannyäsa order of life in spite of all difficulties. The difficulties
usually arise from having to sever family relationships, to give up the
connection of wife and children. But if anyone is able to tolerate such
difficulties, surely his path to spiritual realization is complete. Similarly,
in Arjuna’s discharge of duties as a kñatriya, he is advised to persevere, even
if it is difficult to fight with his family members or similarly beloved
persons. Lord Caitanya took sannyäsa at the age of twenty-four, and His
dependants, young wife as well as old mother, had no one else to look after
them. Yet for a higher cause He took sannyäsa and was steady in the discharge of
higher duties. That is the way of achieving liberation from material bondage.

TRANSLATION
Those who are seers of the truth have concluded that of the nonexistent there is
no endurance, and of the existent there is no cessation. This seers have
concluded by studying the nature of both.

PURPORT
There is no endurance of the changing body. That the body is changing every
moment by the actions and reactions of the different cells is admitted by modern
medical science; and thus growth and old age are taking place in the body. But
the spirit soul exists permanently, remaining the same despite all changes of
the body and the mind. That is the difference between matter and spirit. By
nature, the body is ever changing, and the soul is eternal. This conclusion is
established by all classes of seers of the truth, both impersonalist and
personalist. In the Viñëu Puräëa it is stated that Viñëu and His abodes all have
self-illuminated spiritual existence. “Jyotéàñi viñëur bhavanäni viñëuù.” The
words existent and nonexistent refer only to spirit and matter. That is the
version of all seers of truth.

This is the beginning of the instruction by the Lord to the living entities who
are bewildered by the influence of ignorance. Removal of ignorance involves the
reestablishment of the eternal relationship between the worshiper and the
worshipable and the consequent understanding of the difference between the part
and parcel living entities and the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One can
understand the nature of the Supreme by thorough study of oneself, the
difference between oneself and the Supreme being understood as the relationship
between the part and the whole. In the Vedänta-sütras, as well as in the
Çrémad-Bhägavatam, the Supreme has been accepted as the origin of all
emanations. Such emanations are experienced by superior and inferior natural
sequences. The living entities belong to the superior nature, as it will be
revealed in the Seventh Chapter. Although there is no difference between the
energy and the energetic, the energetic is accepted as the Supreme, and energy
or nature is accepted as the subordinate. The living entities, therefore, are
always subordinate to the Supreme Lord, as in the case of the master and the
servant, or the teacher and the taught. Such clear knowledge is impossible to
understand under the spell of ignorance, and to drive away such ignorance the
Lord teaches the Bhagavad-gétä for the enlightenment of all living entities for
all time.

TRANSLATION
Know that which pervades the entire body is indestructible. No one is able to

PURPORT
This verse more clearly explains the real nature of the soul, which is spread
all over the body. Anyone can understand what is spread all over the body: it is
consciousness. Everyone is conscious of the pains and pleasures of the body in
part or as a whole. This spreading of consciousness is limited within one’s own
body. The pains and pleasures of one body are unknown to another. Therefore,
each and every body is the embodiment of an individual soul, and the symptom of
the soul’s presence is perceived as individual consciousness. This soul is
described as one ten-thousandth part of the upper portion of the hair point in
size. The Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad confirms this:

bälägra-çata-bhägasya çatadhä kalpitasya ca
bhägo jévaù sa vijïeyaù sa cänantyäya kalpate.

 “When the upper point of a hair is divided into one hundred parts and again
each of such parts is further divided into one hundred parts, each such part is
the measurement of the dimension of the spirit soul.” (Svet. 5.9) Similarly, in
the Bhägavatam the same version is stated:

keçägra-çata-bhägasya çatäàçaù sädåçätmakaù
jévaù sükñma-svarupo ’yaà saìkhyätéto hi cit-kaëaù

“There are innumerable particles of spiritual atoms, which are measured as one
ten-thousandth of the upper portion of the hair.”

Therefore, the individual particle of spirit soul is a spiritual atom smaller
than the material atoms, and such atoms are innumerable. This very small
spiritual spark is the basic principle of the material body, and the influence
of such a spiritual spark is spread all over the body as the influence of the
active principle of some medicine spreads throughout the body. This current of
the spirit soul is felt all over the body as consciousness, and that is the
proof of the presence of the soul. Any layman can understand that the material
body minus consciousness is a dead body, and this consciousness cannot be
revived in the body by any means of material administration. Therefore,
consciousness is not due to any amount of material combination, but to the
spirit soul. In the Muëòaka Upaniñad the measurement of the atomic spirit soul
is further explained:

eño ’ëurätmä cetasä veditavyo

“The soul is atomic in size and can be perceived by perfect intelligence. This
atomic soul is floating in the five kinds of air [präëa, apäna, vyäna, samäna
and udäna], is situated within the heart, and spreads its influence all over the
body of the embodied living entities. When the soul is purified from the
contamination of the five kinds of material air, its spiritual influence is
exhibited.” (Muëò. 3.1.9)

The haöha-yoga system is meant for controlling the five kinds of air encircling
the pure soul by different kinds of sitting postures—not for any material
profit, but for liberation of the minute soul from the entanglement of the
material atmosphere.

So the constitution of the atomic soul is admitted in all Vedic literatures, and
it is also actually felt in the practical experience of any sane man. Only the
insane man can think of this atomic soul as all-pervading Viñëu-tattva.

The influence of the atomic soul can be spread all over a particular body.
According to the Muëòaka Upaniñad, this atomic soul is situated in the heart of
every living entity, and because the measurement of the atomic soul is beyond
the power of appreciation of the material scientists, some of them assert
foolishly that there is no soul. The individual atomic soul is definitely there
in the heart along with the Supersoul, and thus all the energies of bodily
movement are emanating from this part of the body. The corpuscles which carry
the oxygen from the lungs gather energy from the soul. When the soul passes away
from this position, activity of the blood, generating fusion, ceases. Medical
science accepts the importance of the red corpuscles, but it cannot ascertain
that the source of the energy is the soul. Medical science, however, does admit
that the heart is the seat of all energies of the body.

Such atomic particles of the spirit whole are compared to the sunshine
molecules. In the sunshine there are innumerable radiant molecules. Similarly,
the fragmental parts of the Supreme Lord are atomic sparks of the rays of the
Supreme Lord, called by the name prabhä or superior energy. Neither Vedic
knowledge nor modern science denies the existence of the spirit soul in the
body, and the science of the soul is explicitly described in the Bhagavad-gétä
by the Personality of Godhead Himself.

TRANSLATION
Only the material body of the indestructible, immeasurable and eternal living
entity is subject to destruction; therefore, fight, O descendant of Bharata.

PURPORT
The material body is perishable by nature. It may perish immediately, or it may
do so after a hundred years. It is a question of time only. There is no chance
of maintaining it indefinitely. But the spirit soul is so minute that it cannot
even be seen by an enemy, to say nothing of being killed. As mentioned in the
previous verse, it is so small that no one can have any idea how to measure its
dimension. So from both viewpoints there is no cause of lamentation because the
living entity can neither be killed as he is, nor can the material body, which
cannot be saved for any length of time, be permanently protected. The minute
particle of the whole spirit acquires this material body according to his work,
and therefore observance of religious principles should be utilized. In the
Vedänta-sütras the living entity is qualified as light because he is part and
parcel of the supreme light. As sunlight maintains the entire universe, so the
light of the soul maintains this material body. As soon as the spirit soul is
out of this material body, the body begins to decompose; therefore it is the
spirit soul which maintains this body. The body itself is unimportant. Arjuna
was advised to fight and sacrifice the material body for the cause of religion.

TRANSLATION
He who thinks that the living entity is the slayer or that he is slain, does not
understand. One who is in knowledge knows that the self slays not nor is slain.

PURPORT
When an embodied living entity is hurt by fatal weapons, it is to be known that
the living entity within the body is not killed. The spirit soul is so small
that it is impossible to kill him by any material weapon, as is evident from the
previous verses. Nor is the living entity killable because of his spiritual
constitution. What is killed, or is supposed to be killed, is the body only.
This, however, does not at all encourage killing of the body. The Vedic
injunction is, “mähiàsyät sarva-bhütäni” never commit violence to anyone. Nor
does understanding that the living entity is not killed encourage animal
slaughter. Killing the body of anyone without authority is abominable and is
punishable by the law of the state as well as by the law of the Lord. Arjuna,
however, is being engaged in killing for the principle of religion, and not
whimsically.

TRANSLATION
For the soul there is never birth nor death. Nor, having once been, does he ever
cease to be. He is unborn, eternal, ever-existing, undying and primeval. He is
not slain when the body is slain.

PURPORT
Qualitatively, the small atomic fragmental part of the Supreme Spirit is one
with the Supreme. He undergoes no changes like the body. Sometimes the soul is
called the steady, or küöastha. The body is subject to six kinds of
transformations. It takes its birth in the womb of the mother’s body, remains
for some time, grows, produces some effects, gradually dwindles, and at last
vanishes into oblivion. The soul, however, does not go through such changes. The
soul is not born, but, because he takes on a material body, the body takes its
birth. The soul does not take birth there, and the soul does not die. Anything
which has birth also has death. And because the soul has no birth, he therefore
has no past, present or future. He is eternal, ever-existing, and primeval—that
is, there is no trace in history of his coming into being. Under the impression
of the body, we seek the history of birth, etc., of the soul. The soul does not
at any time become old, as the body does. The so-called old man, therefore,
feels himself to be in the same spirit as in his childhood or youth. The changes
of the body do not affect the soul. The soul does not deteriorate like a tree,
nor anything material. The soul has no by-product either. The by-products of the
body, namely children, are also different individual souls; and, owing to the
body, they appear as children of a particular man. The body develops because of
the soul’s presence, but the soul has neither offshoots nor change. Therefore,
the soul is free from the six changes of the body.

In the Kaöha Upaniñad also we find a similar passage which reads:

na jäyate mriyate vä vipaçcin
näyaà kutaçcin na vibhüva kaçcit
ajo nityaù çäçvato ’yaà puräëo
na hanyate hanyamäne çarére.

(Kaöha 1.2.18)

The meaning and purport of this verse is the same as in the Bhagavad-gétä, but
here in this verse there is one special word, vipaçcit, which means learned or
with knowledge.

The soul is full of knowledge, or full always with consciousness. Therefore,
consciousness is the symptom of the soul. Even if one does not find the soul
within the heart, where he is situated, one can still understand the presence of
the soul simply by the presence of consciousness. Sometimes we do not find the
sun in the sky owing to clouds, or for some other reason, but the light of the
sun is always there, and we are convinced that it is therefore daytime. As soon
as there is a little light in the sky early in the morning, we can understand
that the sun is in the sky. Similarly, since there is some consciousness in all
bodies—whether man or animal—we can understand the presence of the soul. This
consciousness of the soul is, however, different from the consciousness of the
Supreme because the supreme consciousness is all-knowledge—past, present and
future. The consciousness of the individual soul is prone to be forgetful. When
he is forgetful of his real nature, he obtains education and enlightenment from
the superior lessons of Kåñëa. But Kåñëa is not like the forgetful soul. If so,
Kåñëa’s teachings of Bhagavad-gétä would be useless.

There are two kinds of souls—namely the minute particle soul (aëu-ätmä) and the
Supersoul (the vibhu-ätmä). This is also confirmed in the Kaöha Upaniñad in this
way:

aëor aëéyän mahato mahéyän
ätmäsya jantor nihito guhäyäm
tam akratuù paçyati véta-çoko
dhätuù prasädän mahimänam ätmanaù

(Kaöha 1.2.20)

“Both the Supersoul [Paramätmä] and the atomic soul [jévätmä] are situated on
the same tree of the body within the same heart of the living being, and only
one who has become free from all material desires as well as lamentations can,
by the grace of the Supreme, understand the glories of the soul.” Kåñëa is the
fountainhead of the Supersoul also, as it will be disclosed in the following
chapters, and Arjuna is the atomic soul, forgetful of his real nature; therefore
he requires to be enlightened by Kåñëa, or by His bona fide representative (the
spiritual master).

TRANSLATION
O Pärtha, how can a person who knows that the soul is indestructible, unborn,
eternal and immutable, kill anyone or cause anyone to kill?

PURPORT
Everything has its proper utility, and a man who is situated in complete
knowledge knows how and where to apply a thing for its proper utility.
Similarly, violence also has its utility, and how to apply violence rests with
the person in knowledge. Although the justice of the peace awards capital
punishment to a person condemned for murder, the justice of the peace cannot be
blamed because he orders violence to another person according to the codes of
justice. In Manu-saàhitä, the lawbook for mankind, it is supported that a
murderer should be condemned to death so that in his next life he will not have
to suffer for the great sin he has committed. Therefore, the king’s punishment
of hanging a murderer is actually beneficial. Similarly, when Kåñëa orders
fighting, it must be concluded that violence is for supreme justice, and, as
such, Arjuna should follow the instruction, knowing well that such violence,
committed in the act of fighting for Kåñëa, is not violence at all because, at
any rate, the man, or rather the soul, cannot be killed; so for the
administration of justice, so-called violence is permitted. A surgical operation
is not meant to kill the patient, but to cure him. Therefore the fighting to be
executed by Arjuna at the instruction of Kåñëa is with full knowledge, so there
is no possibility of sinful reaction.

TRANSLATION
As a person puts on new garments, giving up old ones, similarly, the soul
accepts new material bodies, giving up the old and useless ones.

PURPORT
Change of body by the atomic individual soul is an accepted fact. Even some of
the modern scientists who do not believe in the existence of the soul, but at
the same time cannot explain the source of energy from the heart, have to accept
continuous changes of body which appear from childhood to boyhood and from
boyhood to youth and again from youth to old age. From old age, the change is
transferred to another body. This has already been explained in the previous
verse.

Transference of the atomic individual soul to another body is made possible by
the grace of the Supersoul.The Supersoul fulfills the desire of the atomic soul
as one friend fulfills the desire of another. The Vedas, like the Muëòaka
Upaniñad, as well as the Çvetäçvatara Upanisad, compare the soul and the
Supersoul to two friendly birds sitting on the same tree. One of the birds (the
individual atomic soul) is eating the fruit of the tree, and the other bird
(Kåñëa) is simply watching His friend. Of these two birds—although they are the
same in quality—one is captivated by the fruits of the material tree, while the
other is simply witnessing the activities of His friend. Kåñëa is the witnessing
bird, and Arjuna is the eating bird. Although they are friends, one is still the
master and the other is the servant. Forgetfulness of this relationship by the
atomic soul is the cause of one’s changing his position from one tree to another
or from one body to another. The jéva soul is struggling very hard on the tree
of the material body, but as soon as he agrees to accept the other bird as the
supreme spiritual master—as Arjuna agreed to do by voluntary surrender unto
Kåñëa for instruction—the subordinate bird immediately becomes free from all
lamentations. Both the Kaöha Upaniñad and Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad confirm this:

samäne våkñe puruño nimagno
’néçayä çocati muhyamänaù
juñöaà yadä paçyaty anyam éçam asya
mahimänam iti véta-çokaù

“Although the two birds are in the same tree, the eating bird is fully engrossed
with anxiety and moroseness as the enjoyer of the fruits of the tree. But if in
some way or other he turns his face to his friend who is the Lord and knows His
glories—at once the suffering bird becomes free from all anxieties.” Arjuna has
now turned his face towards his eternal friend, Kåñëa, and is understanding the
Bhagavad-gétä from Him. And thus, hearing from Kåñëa, he can understand the
supreme glories of the Lord and be free from lamentation.

Arjuna is advised herewith by the Lord not to lament for the bodily change of
his old grandfather and his teacher. He should rather be happy to kill their
bodies in the righteous fight so that they may be cleansed at once of all
reactions from various bodily activities. One who lays down his life on the
sacrificial altar, or in the proper battlefield, is at once cleansed of bodily
reactions and promoted to a higher status of life. So there was no cause for
Arjuna’s lamentation.

TRANSLATION
The soul can never be cut into pieces by any weapon, nor can he be burned by
fire, nor moistened by water, nor withered by the wind.

PURPORT
All kinds of weapons, swords, flames, rains, tornadoes, etc., are unable to kill
the spirit soul. It appears that there were many kinds of weapons made of earth,
water, air, ether, etc., in addition to the modern weapons of fire. Even the
nuclear weapons of the modern age are classified as fire weapons, but formerly
there were other weapons made of all different types of material elements.
Firearms were counteracted by water weapons, which are now unknown to modern
science. Nor do modern scientists have knowledge of tornado weapons.
Nonetheless, the soul can never be cut into pieces, nor annihilated by any
number of weapons, regardless of scientific devices.

Nor was it ever possible to cut the individual souls from the original Soul. The
Mäyävädé, however, cannot describe how the individual soul evolved from
ignorance and consequently became covered by illusory energy. Because they are
atomic individual souls (sanätana) eternally, they are prone to be covered by
the illusory energy, and thus they become separated from the association of the
Supreme Lord, just as the sparks of the fire, although one in quality with the
fire, are prone to be extinguished when out of the fire. In the Varäha Puräëa,
the living entities are described as separated parts and parcels of the Supreme.
They are eternally so, according to the Bhagavad-gétä also. So, even after being
liberated from illusion, the living entity remains a separate identity, as is
evident from the teachings of the Lord to Arjuna. Arjuna became liberated by the
knowledge received from Kåñëa, but he never became one with Kåñëa.

TRANSLATION
This individual soul is unbreakable and insoluble, and can be neither burned nor
dried. He is everlasting, all-pervading, unchangeable, immovable and eternally
the same.

PURPORT
All these qualifications of the atomic soul definitely prove that the individual
soul is eternally the atomic particle of the spirit whole, and he remains the
same atom eternally, without change. The theory of monism is very difficult to
apply in this case, because the individual soul is never expected to become one
homogeneously. After liberation from material contamination, the atomic soul may
prefer to remain as a spiritual spark in the effulgent rays of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, but the intelligent souls enter into the spiritual
planets to associate with the Personality of Godhead.

The word sarva-gataù (all-pervading) is significant because there is no doubt
that living entities are all over God’s creation. They live on the land, in the
water, in the air, within the earth and even within fire. The belief that they
are sterilized in fire is not acceptable, because it is clearly stated here that
the soul cannot be burned by fire. Therefore, there is no doubt that there are
living entities also in the sun planet with suitable bodies to live there. If
the sun globe is uninhabited, then the word sarva-gataù—living
everywhere—becomes meaningless.

TRANSLATION
It is said that the soul is invisible, inconceivable, immutable, and
unchangeable. Knowing this, you should not grieve for the body.

PURPORT
As described previously, the magnitude of the soul is so small for our material
calculation that he cannot be seen even by the most powerful microscope;
therefore, he is invisible. As far as the soul’s existence is concerned, no one
can establish his existence experimentally beyond the proof of çruti or Vedic
wisdom. We have to accept this truth, because there is no other source of
understanding the existence of the soul, although it is a fact by perception.
There are many things we have to accept solely on grounds of superior authority.
No one can deny the existence of his father, based upon the authority of his
mother. There is no other source of understanding the identity of the father
except by the authority of the mother. Similarly, there is no other source of
understanding the soul except by studying the Vedas. In other words, the soul is
inconceivable by human experimental knowledge. The soul is consciousness and
conscious—that also is the statement of the Vedas, and we have to accept that.
Unlike the bodily changes, there is no change in the soul. As eternally
unchangeable, the soul remains atomic in comparison to the infinite Supreme
Soul. The Supreme Soul is infinite, and the atomic soul is infinitesimal.
Therefore, the infinitesimal soul, being unchangeable, can never become equal to
the infinite soul, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This concept is
repeated in the Vedas in different ways just to confirm the stability of the
conception of the soul. Repetition of something is necessary in order that we
understand the matter thoroughly without error.

TRANSLATION
If, however, you think that the soul is perpetually born and always dies, still
you have no reason to lament, O mighty-armed.

PURPORT
There is always a class of philosophers, almost akin to the Buddhists, who do
not believe in the separate existence of the soul beyond the body. When Lord
Kåñëa spoke the Bhagavad-gétä, it appears that such philosophers existed, and
they were known as the Lokäyatikas and Vaibhäñikas. These philosophers
maintained that life symptoms, or soul, takes place at a certain mature
condition of material combination. The modern material scientist and materialist
philosophers also think similarly. According to them, the body is a combination
of physical elements, and at a certain stage the life symptoms develop by
interaction of the physical and chemical elements. The science of anthropology
is based on this philosophy. Currently, many pseudo-religions—now becoming
fashionable in America—are also adhering to this philosophy, as well as to the
nihilistic nondevotional Buddhist sects.

Even if Arjuna did not believe in the existence of the soul—as in the Vaibhäñika
philosophy—there would still have been no cause for lamentation. No one laments
the loss of a certain bulk of chemicals and stops discharging his prescribed
duty. On the other hand, in modern science and scientific warfare, so many tons
of chemicals are wasted for achieving victory over the enemy. According to the
Vaibhäñika philosophy, the so-called soul or ätmä vanishes along with the
deterioration of the body. So, in any case, whether Arjuna accepted the Vedic
conclusion that there is an atomic soul, or whether he did not believe in the
existence of the soul, he had no reason to lament. According to this theory,
since there are so many living entities generating out of matter every moment,
and so many of them are being vanquished every moment, there is no need to
grieve for such an incidence. However, since he was not risking rebirth of the
soul, Arjuna had no reason to be afraid of being affected with sinful reactions
due to his killing his grandfather and teacher. But at the same time, Kåñëa
sarcastically addressed Arjuna as mahä-bähu, mighty-armed, because He, at least,
did not accept the theory of the Vaibhäñikas, which leaves aside the Vedic
wisdom. As a kñatriya, Arjuna belonged to the Vedic culture, and it behooved him
to continue to follow its principles.

TRANSLATION
For one who has taken his birth, death is certain; and for one who is dead,
birth is certain. Therefore, in the unavoidable discharge of your duty, you
should not lament.

PURPORT
One has to take birth according to one’s activities of life. And, after
finishing one term of activities, one has to die to take birth for the next. In
this way the cycle of birth and death is revolving, one after the other without
liberation. This cycle of birth and death does not, however, support unnecessary
murder, slaughter and war. But at the same time, violence and war are inevitable
factors in human society for keeping law and order.

The Battle of Kurukñetra, being the will of the Supreme, was an inevitable
event, and to fight for the right cause is the duty of a kñatriya. Why should he
be afraid of or aggrieved at the death of his relatives since he was discharging
his proper duty? He did not deserve to break the law, thereby becoming subjected
to the reactions of sinful acts, of which he was so afraid. By avoiding the
discharge of his proper duty, he would not be able to stop the death of his
relatives, and he would be degraded due to his selection of the wrong path of
action.

TRANSLATION
All created beings are unmanifest in their beginning, manifest in their interim
state, and unmanifest again when they are annihilated. So what need is there for
lamentation?

PURPORT
Accepting that there are two classes of philosophers, one believing in the
existence of soul and the other not believing in the existence of the soul,
there is no cause for lamentation in either case. Nonbelievers in the existence
of the soul are called atheists by followers of Vedic wisdom. Yet even if, for
argument’s sake, we accept the atheistic theory, there is still no cause for
lamentation. Apart from the separate existence of the soul, the material
elements remain unmanifested before creation. From this subtle state of
unmanifestation comes manifestation, just as from ether, air is generated; from
air, fire is generated; from fire, water is generated; and from water, earth
becomes manifested. From the earth, many varieties of manifestations take place.
Take, for example, a big skyscraper manifested from the earth. When it is
dismantled, the manifestation becomes again unmanifested and remains as atoms in
the ultimate stage. The law of conservation of energy remains, but in course of
time things are manifested and unmanifested—that is the difference. Then what
cause is there for lamentation either in the stage of manifestation or
unmanifestation? Somehow or other, even in the unmanifested stage, things are
not lost. Both at the beginning and at the end, all elements remain
unmanifested, and only in the middle are they manifested, and this does not make
any real material difference.

And if we accept the Vedic conclusion as stated in the Bhagavad-gétä (antavanta
ime dehäù) that these material bodies are perishable in due course of time
(nityasyoktäù çarériëaù) but that soul is eternal, then we must remember always
that the body is like a dress; therefore why lament the changing of a dress? The
material body has no factual existence in relation to the eternal soul. It is
something like a dream. In a dream we may think of flying in the sky, or sitting
on a chariot as a king, but when we wake up we can see that we are neither in
the sky nor seated on the chariot. The Vedic wisdom encourages self-realization
on the basis of the nonexistence of the material body. Therefore, in either
case, whether one believes in the existence of the soul, or one does not believe
in the existence of the soul, there is no cause for lamentation for loss of the
body.

Since Gétopaniñad is largely based on the principles of the Upaniñads, it is not
surprising to also find this passage in the Kaöha Upaniñad.

The fact that the atomic soul is within the body of a gigantic animal, in the
body of a gigantic banyan tree, and also in the microbic germs, millions and
billions of which occupy only an inch of space, is certainly very amazing. Men
with a poor fund of knowledge and men who are not austere cannot understand the
wonders of the individual atomic spark of spirit, even though it is explained by
the greatest authority of knowledge, who imparted lessons even to Brahmä, the
first living being in the universe. Owing to a gross material conception of
things, most men in this age cannot imagine how such a small particle can become
both so great and so small. So men look at the soul proper as wonderful either
by constitution or by description. Illusioned by the material energy, people are
so engrossed in subject matter for sense gratification that they have very
little time to understand the question of self-understanding, even though it is
a fact that without this self-understanding all activities result in ultimate
defeat in the struggle for existence. Perhaps one has no idea that one must
think of the soul, and also make a solution of the material miseries.

Some people who are inclined to hear about the soul may be attending lectures,
in good association, but sometimes, owing to ignorance, they are misguided by
acceptance of the Supersoul and the atomic soul as one without distinction of
magnitude. It is very difficult to find a man who perfectly understands the
position of the soul, the Supersoul, the atomic soul, their respective
functions, relationships and all other major and minor details. And it is still
more difficult to find a man who has actually derived full benefit from
knowledge of the soul, and who is able to describe the position of the soul in
different aspects. But if, somehow or other, one is able to understand the
subject matter of the soul, then one’s life is successful. The easiest process
for understanding the subject matter of self, however, is to accept the
statements of the Bhagavad-gétä spoken by the greatest authority, Lord Kåñëa,
without being deviated by other theories. But it also requires a great deal of
penance and sacrifice, either in this life or in the previous ones, before one
is able to accept Kåñëa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Kåñëa can,
however, be known as such by the causeless mercy of the pure devotee and by no
other way.

PURPORT
The Lord now concludes the chapter of instruction on the immutable spirit soul.
In describing the immortal soul in various ways, Lord Kåñëa establishes that the
soul is immortal and the body is temporary. Therefore Arjuna as a kñatriya
should not abandon his duty out of fear that his grandfather and teacher—Bhéñma
and Droëa—will die in the battle. On the authority of Çré Kåñëa, one has to
believe that there is a soul different from the material body, not that there is
no such thing as soul, or that living symptoms develop at a certain stage of
material maturity resulting from the interaction of chemicals. Though the soul
is immortal, violence is not encouraged, but at the time of war it is not
discouraged when there is actual need for it. That need must be justified in
terms of the sanction of the Lord, and not capriciously.

Considering your specific duty as a kñatriya, you should know that there is no

no need for hesitation.

PURPORT
Out of the four orders of social administration, the second order, for the
matter of good administration, is called kñatriya. Kñat means hurt. One who
gives protection from harm is called kñatriya (trayate—to give protection). The
kñatriyas are trained for killing in the forest. A kñatriya would go into the
forest and challenge a tiger face to face and fight with the tiger with his
sword. When the tiger was killed, it would be offered the royal order of
cremation. This system is being followed even up to the present day by the
kñatriya kings of Jaipur state. The kñatriyas are specially trained for
challenging and killing because religious violence is sometimes a necessary
factor. Therefore, kñatriyas are never meant for accepting directly the order of
sannyäsa or renunciation. Nonviolence in politics may be a diplomacy, but it is
never a factor or principle. In the religious law books it is stated:

ähaveñu mitho ’nyonyaà jighäàsanto mahékñitaù
yuddhamänäù paraà çaktyä svargaà yänty aparäìmukhäù
yajïeñu paçavo brahman hanyante satataà dvijaiù
saàskåtäù kila mantraiç ca te ’pi svargam aväpnuvan.

“In the battlefield, a king or kñatriya, while fighting another king envious of
him, is eligible for achieving heavenly planets after death, as the brähmaëas
also attain the heavenly planets by sacrificing animals in the sacrificial
fire.” Therefore, killing on the battle on the religious principle and the
killing of animals in the sacrificial fire are not at all considered to be acts
of violence, because everyone is benefitted by the religious principles
involved. The animal sacrificed gets a human life immediately without undergoing
the gradual evolutionary process from one form to another, and the kñatriyas
killed in the battlefield also attain the heavenly planets as do the brähmaëas
who attain them by offering sacrifice.

There are two kinds of svadharmas, specific duties. As long as one is not
liberated, one has to perform the duties of that particular body in accordance
with religious principles in order to achieve liberation. When one is liberated,
one’s svadharma—specific duty—becomes spiritual and is not in the material
bodily concept. In the bodily conception of life there are specific duties for
the brähmaëas and kñatriyas respectively, and such duties are unavoidable.
Svadharma is ordained by the Lord, and this will be clarified in the Fourth
Chapter. On the bodily plane svadharma is called varëäçrama-dharma, or man’s
steppingstone for spiritual understanding. Human civilization begins from the
stage of varëäçrama-dharma, or specific duties in terms of the specific modes of
nature of the body obtained. Discharging one’s specific duty in any field of
action in accordance with varëäçrama-dharma serves to elevate one to a higher
status of life.

PURPORT
As supreme teacher of the world, Lord Kåñëa condemns the attitude of Arjuna who
said, “I do not find any good in this fighting. It will cause perpetual
habitation in hell.” Such statements by Arjuna were due to ignorance only. He
wanted to become nonviolent in the discharge of his specific duty. For a
kñatriya to be in the battlefield and to become nonviolent is the philosophy of
fools. In the Paräçara-småti or religious codes made by Paräçara, the great sage
and father of Vyäsadeva, it is stated:

kñatriyo hi prajä rakñan çastra-päëiù pradaëòayan
nirjitya parasainyädi kñitià dharmeëa pälayet.

“The kñatriya’s duty is to protect the citizens from all kinds of difficulties,
and for that reason he has to apply violence in suitable cases for law and
order. Therefore he has to conquer the soldiers of inimical kings, and thus,
with religious principles, he should rule over the world.”

Considering all aspects, Arjuna had no reason to refrain from fighting. If he
should conquer his enemies, he would enjoy the kingdom; and if he should die in
the battle, he would be elevated to the heavenly planets whose doors were wide
open to him. Fighting would be for his benefit in either case.

PURPORT
Arjuna was a famous fighter, and he attained fame by fighting many great
demigods, including even Lord Çiva. After fighting and defeating Lord Çiva in
the dress of a hunter, Arjuna pleased the Lord and received as a reward a weapon
called päçupata-astra. Everyone knew that he was a great warrior. Even
Droëäcärya gave him benediction and awarded him the special weapon by which he
could kill even his teacher. So he was credited with so many military
certificates from many authorities, including his adopted father Indra, the
heavenly king. But if he abandoned the battle, he would not only neglect his
specific duty as a kñatriya, but he would lose all his fame and good name and
thus prepare his royal road to hell. In other words, he would go to hell, not by
fighting, but by withdrawing from battle.

PURPORT
Both as friend and philosopher to Arjuna, Lord Kåñëa now gives His final
judgement regarding Arjuna’s refusal to fight. The Lord says, “Arjuna, if you
leave the battlefield, people will call you a coward even before your actual
flight. And if you think that people may call you bad names but that you will
save your life by fleeing the battlefield, then My advice is that you’d do
better to die in the battle. For a respectable man like you, ill fame is worse
than death. So, you should not flee for fear of your life; better to die in the
battle. That will save you from the ill fame of misusing My friendship and from
losing your prestige in society.”

So, the final judgement of the Lord was for Arjuna to die in the battle and not
withdraw.

generals like Duryodhana, Karëa, and other contemporaries will think that you

They will think that you have left out of fear for your life. And thus their

Lord Kåñëa was astonished in the beginning at Arjuna’s uncalled-for plea for

compassion.

PURPORT
Lord Kåñëa now directly says that Arjuna should fight for the sake of fighting
because He desires the battle. There is no consideration of happiness or
distress, profit or gain, victory or defeat in the activities of Kåñëa
consciousness. That everything should be performed for the sake of Kåñëa is
transcendental consciousness; so there is no reaction to material activities. He
who acts for his own sense gratification, either in goodness or in passion, is
subject to the reaction, good or bad. But he who has completely surrendered
himself in the activities of Kåñëa consciousness is no longer obliged to anyone,
nor is he a debtor to anyone, as one is in the ordinary course of activities. It
is said:

devarñi-bhutäpta-nåëäà pitèëäà
na kiìkaro näyamåëé ca räjan
sarvätmanä yaù çaraëaà çaraëyaà

(Bhag. 11.5.41)

“Anyone who has completely surrendered unto Kåñëa, Mukunda, giving up all other
duties, is no longer a debtor, nor is he obliged to anyone—not the demigods, nor
the sages, nor the people in general, nor kinsmen, nor humanity, nor
forefathers.” That is the indirect hint given by Kåñëa to Arjuna in this verse,
and the matter will be more clearly explained in the following verses.


TEXT 39

Thus far I have declared to you the analytical knowledge of säìkhya philosophy.
Now listen to the knowledge of yoga whereby one works without fruitive result. O
son of Påthä, when you act by such intelligence, you can free yourself from the
bondage of works.

PURPORT
According to the Nirukti, or the Vedic dictionary, saìkhya means that which
describes phenomena in detail, and saìkhya refers to that philosophy which
describes the real nature of the soul. And yoga involves controlling the senses.
Arjuna’s proposal not to fight was based on sense gratification. Forgetting his
prime duty, he wanted to cease fighting because he thought that by not killing
his relatives and kinsmen he would be happier than by enjoying the kingdom by
conquering his cousins and brothers, the sons of Dhåtaräñöra. In both ways, the
basic principles were for sense gratification. Happiness derived from conquering
them and happiness derived by seeing kinsmen alive are both on the basis of
persona1 sense gratification, for there is a sacrifice of wisdom and duty.
Kåñëa, therefore, wanted to explain to Arjuna that by killing the body of his
grandfather he would not be killing the soul proper, and He explained that all
individual persons, including the Lord Himself, are eternal individuals; they
were individuals in the past, they are individuals in the present, and they will
continue to remain individuals in the future, because all of us are individual
souls eternally, and we simply change our bodily dress in different manners.
But, actually, we keep our individuality even after liberation from the bondage
of material dress. An analytical study of the soul and the body has been very
graphically explained by Lord Kåñëa. And this descriptive knowledge of the soul
and the body from different angles of vision has been described here as säìkhya,
in terms of the Nirukti dictionary. This säìkhya has nothing to do with the
säìkhya philosophy of the atheist Kapila. Long before the imposter Kapila’s
säìkhya, the säìkhya philosophy was expounded in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam by the
true Lord Kapila, the incarnation of Lord Kåñëa, who explained it to His mother,
Devahüti. It is clearly explained by Him that the Puruña, or the Supreme Lord,
is active and that He creates by looking over the prakåti. This is accepted in
the Vedas and in the Gétä. The description in the Vedas indicates that the Lord
glanced over the prakåti, or nature, and impregnated it with atomic individuals
souls. All these individuals are working in the material world for sense
gratification, and under the spell of material energy they are thinking of being
enjoyers. This mentality is dragged to the last point of liberation when the
living entity wants to become one with the Lord. This is the last snare of mäyä
or sense gratificatory illusion, and it is only after many, many births of such
sense gratificatory activities that a great soul surrenders unto Väsudeva, Lord
Kåñëa, thereby fulfilling the search after the ultimate truth.

Arjuna has already accepted Kåñëa as his spiritual master by surrendering
himself unto Him: çiñyas te ’haà çädhi mäà tväà prapannam. Consequently, Kåñëa
will now tell him about the working process in buddhi-yoga, or karma-yoga, or in
other words, the practice of devotional service only for the sense gratification
of the Lord. This buddhi-yoga is clearly explained in Chapter Ten, verse ten, as
being direct communion with the Lord, who is sitting as Paramätmä in everyone’s
heart. But such communion does not take place without devotional service. One
who is therefore situated in devotional or transcendental loving service to the
Lord, or, in other words, in Kåñëa consciousness, attains to this stage of
buddhi-yoga by the special grace of the Lord. The Lord says, therefore, that
only to those who are always engaged in devotional service out of transcendental
love does He award the pure knowledge of devotion in love. In that way the
devotee can reach Him easily in the ever-blissful kingdom of God.

Thus the buddhi-yoga mentioned in this verse is the devotional service of the
Lord, and the word säìkhya mentioned herein has nothing to do with the atheistic
säìkhya-yoga enunciated by the impostor Kapila. One should not, therefore,
misunderstand that the säìkhya-yoga mentioned herein has any connection with the
atheistic säìkhya. Nor did that philosophy have any influence during that time;
nor would Lord Kåñëa care to mention such godless philosophical speculations.
Real säìkhya philosophy is described by Lord Kapila in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam,
but even that säìkhya has nothing to do with the current topics. Here, säìkhya
means analytical description of the body and the soul. Lord Kåñëa made an
analytical description of the soul just to bring Arjuna to the point of
buddhi-yoga, or bhakti-yoga. Therefore, Lord Kåñëa’s säìkhya and Lord Kapila’s
säìkhya, as described in the Bhägavatam; are one and the same. They are all
bhakti-yoga. He said, therefore, that only the less intelligent class of men
make a distinction between säìkhya-yoga and bhakti-yoga.

Of course, atheistic säìkhya-yoga has nothing to do with bhakti-yoga, yet the
unintelligent claim that the atheistic säìkhya-yoga is referred to in the
Bhagavad-gétä.

One should therefore understand that buddhi-yoga means to work in Kåñëa
consciousness, in the full bliss and knowledge of devotional service. One who
works for the satisfaction of the Lord only, however difficult such work may be,
is working under the principles of buddhi-yoga and finds himself always in
transcendental bliss. By such transcendental engagement, one achieves all
transcendental qualities automatically, by the grace of the Lord, and thus his
liberation is complete in itself, without his making extraneous endeavors to
acquire knowledge. There is much difference between work in Kåñëa consciousness
and work for fruitive results, especially in the matter of sense gratification
for achieving results in terms of family or material happiness. Buddhi-yoga is
therefore the transcendental quality of the work that we perform.

TRANSLATION
In this endeavor there is no loss or diminution, and a little advancement on
this path can protect one from the most dangerous type of fear.

PURPORT
Activity in Kåñëa consciousness, or acting for the benefit of Kåñëa without
expectation of sense gratification, is the highest transcendental quality of
work. Even a small beginning of such activity finds no impediment, nor can that
small beginning be lost at any stage. Any work begun on the material plane has
to be completed, otherwise the whole attempt becomes a failure. But any work
begun in Kåñëa consciousness has a permanent effect, even though not finished.
The performer of such work is therefore not at a loss even if his work in Kåñëa
consciousness is incomplete. One percent done in Kåñëa consciousness bears
permanent results, so that the next beginning is from the point of two percent;
whereas, in material activity, without a hundred percent success, there is no
profit. Ajämila performed his duty in some percentage of Kåñëa consciousness,
but the result he enjoyed at the end was a hundred percent, by the grace of the
Lord. There is a nice verse in this connection in Çrémad-Bhägavatam:

tyaktvä sva-dharmaà caraëämbujaà harer
bhajan na pakko ’tha patet tato yadi
yatra kva väbhadram abhüd amuñya kià
ko värtha äpto ’bhajatäà sva-dharmataù

“If someone gives up self-gratificatory pursuits and works in Kåñëa
consciousness and then falls down on account of not completing his work, what
loss is there on his part? And, what can one gain if one performs his material
activities perfectly?” (Bhäg. 1.5.17) Or, as the Christians say, “What profiteth
a man if he gain the whole world yet suffers the loss of his eternal soul?”

Material activities and their results end with the body. But work in Kåñëa
consciousness carries the person again to Kåñëa consciousness, even after the
loss of the body. At least one is sure to have a chance in the next life of
being born again as a human being, either in the family of a great cultured
brähmaëa or in a rich aristocratic family that will give one a further chance
for elevation. That is the unique quality of work done in Kåñëa consciousness.

beloved child of the Kurus, the intelligence of those who are irresolute is
many-branched.

PURPORT
A strong faith in Kåñëa consciousness that one should be elevated to the highest
perfection of life is called vyavasäyätmikä intelligence. The
Caitanya-caritämåta [Cc. Madhya 22.62] states:

‘çraddhä’-çabde viçväsa kahe sudåòha niçcaya
kåñëe bhakti kaile sarva-karma kåta haya

Faith means unflinching trust in something sublime. When one is engaged in the
duties of Kåñëa consciousness, he need not act in relationship to the material
world with obligations to family traditions, humanity, or nationality. Fruitive
activities are the engagements of one’s reactions from past good or bad deeds.
When one is awake in Kåñëa consciousness, he need no longer endeavor for good
results in his activities. When one is situated in Kåñëa consciousness, all
activities are on the absolute plane, for they are no longer subject to
dualities like good and bad. The highest perfection of Kåñëa consciousness is
renunciation of the material conception of life. This state is automatically
achieved by progressive Kåñëa consciousness. The resolute purpose of a person in
Kåñëa consciousness is based on knowledge (“Väsudevaù sarvam iti sa mahätmä
sudurlabhaù”) by which one comes to know perfectly that Väsudeva, or Kåñëa, is
the root of all manifested causes. As water on the root of a tree is
automatically distributed to the leaves and branches, in Kåñëa consciousness,
one can render the highest service to everyone—namely self, family, society,
country, humanity, etc. If Kåñëa is satisfied by one’s actions, then everyone
will be satisfied.

Service in Kåñëa consciousness is, however, best practiced under the able
guidance of a spiritual master who is a bona fide representative of Kåñëa, who
knows the nature of the student and who can guide him to act in Kåñëa
consciousness. As such, to be well-versed in Kåñëa consciousness one has to act
firmly and obey the representative of Kåñëa, and one should accept the
instruction of the bona fide spiritual master as one’s mission in life. Çréla
Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkur instructs us, in his famous prayers for the
spiritual master, as follows:

yasya prasädäd bhagavat-prasädo
yasyäprasädänna gatiù kuto ’pi
dhyäyaà stuvaàs tasya yaças tri-sandhyaà
vande guroù çré-caraëäravindam.

“By satisfaction of the spiritual master, the Supreme Personality of Godhead
becomes satisfied. And by not satisfying the spiritual master, there is no
chance of being promoted to the plane of Kåñëa consciousness. I should,
therefore, meditate and pray for his mercy three times a day, and offer my
respectful obeisances unto him, my spiritual master.”

The whole process, however, depends on perfect knowledge of the soul beyond the
conception of the body—not theoretically but practically, when there is no
longer chance for sense gratification manifested in fruitive activities. One who
is not firmly fixed in mind is diverted by various types of fruitive acts.

TRANSLATION
Men of small knowledge are very much attached to the flowery words of the Vedas,
which recommend various fruitive activities for elevation to heavenly planets,
resultant good birth, power, and so forth. Being desirous of sense gratification
and opulent life, they say that there is nothing more than this.

PURPORT
People in general are not very intelligent, and due to their ignorance they are
most attached to the fruitive activities recommended in the karma-käëòa portions
of the Vedas. They do not want anything more than sense gratificatory proposals
for enjoying life in heaven, where wine and women are available and material
opulence is very common. In the Vedas many sacrifices are recommended for
elevation to the heavenly planets, especially the jyotiñöoma sacrifices. In
fact, it is stated that anyone desiring elevation to heavenly planets must
perform these sacrifices, and men with a poor fund of knowledge think that this
is the whole purpose of Vedic wisdom. It is very difficult for such
inexperienced persons to be situated in the determined action of Kåñëa
consciousness. As fools are attached to the flowers of poisonous trees without
knowing the results of such attractions, similarly unenlightened men are
attracted by such heavenly opulence and the sense enjoyment thereof.

In the karma-käëòa section of the Vedas it is said that those who perform the
four monthly penances become eligible to drink the somarasa beverages to become
immortal and happy forever. Even on this earth some are very eager to have
somarasa to become strong and fit to enjoy sense gratifications. Such persons
have no faith in liberation from material bondage, and they are very much
attached to the pompous ceremonies of Vedic sacrifices. They are generally
sensual, and they do not want anything other than the heavenly pleasures of
life. It is understood that there are gardens called nandana-känana in which
there is good opportunity for association with angelic, beautiful women and
having a profuse supply of somarasa wine. Such bodily happiness is certainly
sensual; therefore there are those who are purely attached to material,
temporary happiness, as lords of the material world.

TRANSLATION
In the minds of those who are too attached to sense enjoyment and material
opulence, and who are bewildered by such things, the resolute determination of
devotional service to the Supreme Lord does not take place.

PURPORT
Samädhi means “fixed mind.” The Vedic dictionary, the Nirukti, says, samyag
ädhéyate ’sminn ätmatattva-yäthätmyam: “When the mind is fixed for understanding
the self, it is called samädhi. “Samädhi is never possible for persons
interested in material sense enjoyment, nor for those who are bewildered by such
temporary things. They are more or less condemned by the process of material
energy.

TRANSLATION
The Vedas mainly deal with the subject of the three modes of material nature.
Rise above these modes, O Arjuna. Be transcendental to all of them. Be free from
all dualities and from all anxieties for gain and safety, and be established in
the Self.

PURPORT
All material activities involve actions and reactions in the three modes of
material nature. They are meant for fruitive results, which cause bondage in the
material world. The Vedas deal mostly with fruitive activities to gradually
elevate the general public from the field of sense gratification to a position
on the transcendental plane. Arjuna, as a student and friend of Lord Kåñëa, is
advised to raise himself to the transcendental position of Vedänta philosophy
where, in the beginning, there is brahma-jijïäsä, or questions on the Supreme
Transcendence. All the living entities who are in the material world are
struggling very hard for existence. For them the Lord, after creation of the
material world, gave the Vedic wisdom advising how to live and get rid of the
material entanglement. When the activities for sense gratification, namely the
karma-käëòa chapter, are finished, then the chance for spiritual realization is
offered in the form of the Upaniñads, which are part of different Vedas, as the
Bhagavad-gétä is a part of the fifth Veda, namely the Mahäbhärata. The Upaniñads
mark the beginning of transcendental life.

As long as the material body exists, there are actions and reactions in the
material modes. One has to learn tolerance in the face of dualities such as
happiness and distress, or cold and warmth, and by tolerating such dualities
become free from anxieties regarding gain and loss. This transcendental position
is achieved in full Kåñëa consciousness when one is fully dependant on the good
will of Kåñëa

TRANSLATION
All purposes that are served by the small pond can at once be served by the
great reservoirs of water. Similarly, all the purposes of the Vedas can be
served to one who knows the purpose behind them.

PURPORT
The rituals and sacrifices mentioned in the karma-käëòa division of the Vedic
literature are to encourage gradual development of self-realization. And the
purpose of self-realization is clearly stated in the Fifteenth Chapter of the
Bhagavad-gétä (15.15): the purpose of studying the Vedas is to know Lord Kåñëa,
the primeval cause of everything. So, self-realization means understanding Kåñëa
and one’s eternal relationship with Him. The relationship of the living entities
with Kåñëa is also mentioned in the Fifteenth Chapter of Bhagavad-gétä. The
living entities are parts and parcels of Kåñëa; therefore, revival of Kåñëa
consciousness by the individual living entity is the highest perfectional stage
of Vedic knowledge. This is confirmed in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam (3.33.7) as
follows:

aho bata çvapaco’to garéyän
yaj-jihvägre vartate näma tubhyam
tepus tapas te juhuvuù sasnur äryä
brahmänücur näma gåëanti ye te.

“O my Lord, a person who is chanting Your holy name, although born of a low
family like that of a cäëòäla [dog eater], is situated on the highest platform
of self-realization. Such a person must have performed all kinds of penances and
sacrifices according to Vedic rituals and studied the Vedic literatures many,
many times after taking his bath in all the holy places of pilgrimage. Such a
person is considered to be the best of the Äryan family.” So one must be
intelligent enough to understand the purpose of the Vedas, without being
attached to the rituals only, and must not desire to be elevated to the heavenly
kingdoms for a better quality of sense gratification. It is not possible for the
common man in this age to follow all the rules and regulations of the Vedic
rituals and the injunctions of the Vedäntas and the Upaniñads. It requires much
time, energy, knowledge and resources to execute the purposes of the Vedas. This
is hardly possible in this age. The best purpose of Vedic culture is served,
however, by chanting the holy name of the Lord, as recommended by Lord Caitanya,
the deliverer of all fallen souls. When Lord Caitanya was asked by a great Vedic
scholar, Prakäçänanda Sarasvaté, why He, the Lord, was chanting the holy name of
the Lord like a sentimentalist instead of studying Vedänta philosophy, the Lord
replied that His spiritual master found Him to be a great fool, and thus he
asked Him to chant the holy name of Lord Kåñëa. He did so, and became ecstatic
like a madman. In this age of Kali, most of the population is foolish and not
adequately educated to understand Vedänta philosophy; the best purpose of
Vedänta philosophy is served by inoffensively chanting the holy name of the
Lord. Vedänta is the last word in Vedic wisdom, and the author and knower of the
Vedänta philosophy is Lord Kåñëa; and the highest Vedantist is the great soul
who takes pleasure in chanting the holy name of the Lord. That is the ultimate
purpose of all Vedic mysticism.


TEXT 47
karmaëy evädhikäras te

karmaëi—prescribed duties; eva—certainly; adhikäraù—right; te—of you; mä—never;
phaleñu—in the fruits; kadäcana—at any time; mä—never; karma-phala—in the result
of the work; hetuù—cause; bhüù—become; mä—never; te—of you; saìgaù—attachment;

TRANSLATION
You have a right to perform your prescribed duty, but you are not entitled to
the fruits of action. Never consider yourself to be the cause of the results of
your activities, and never be attached to not doing your duty.

PURPORT
There are three considerations here: prescribed duties, capricious work, and
inaction. Prescribed duties refer to activities performed while one is in the
modes of material nature. Capricious work means actions without the sanction of
authority, and inaction means not performing one’s prescribed duties. The Lord
advised that Arjuna not be inactive, but that he perform his prescribed duty
without being attached to the result. One who is attached to the result of his
work is also the cause of the action. Thus he is the enjoyer or sufferer of the
result of such actions.

As far as prescribed duties are concerned, they can be fitted into three
subdivisions, namely routine work, emergency work and desired activities.
Routine work, in terms of the scriptural injunctions, is done without desire for
results. As one has to do it, obligatory work is action in the mode of goodness.
Work with results becomes the cause of bondage; therefore such work is not
auspicious. Everyone has his proprietory right in regard to prescribed duties,
but should act without attachment to the result; such disinterested obligatory
duties doubtlessly lead one to the path of liberation.

Arjuna was therefore advised by the Lord to fight as a matter of duty without
attachment to the result. His nonparticipation in the battle is another side of
attachment. Such attachment never leads one to the path of salvation. Any
attachment, positive or negative, is cause for bondage. Inaction is sinful.
Therefore, fighting as a matter of duty was the only auspicious path of
salvation for Arjuna.

TRANSLATION
Be steadfast in yoga, O Arjuna. Perform your duty and abandon all attachment to
success or failure. Such evenness of mind is called yoga.

PURPORT
Kåñëa tells Arjuna that he should act in yoga. And what is that yoga? Yoga means
to concentrate the mind upon the Supreme by controlling the ever-disturbing
senses. And who is the Supreme? The Supreme is the Lord. And because He Himself
is telling Arjuna to fight, Arjuna has nothing to do with the results of the
fight. Gain or victory are Kåñëa’s concern; Arjuna is simply advised to act
according to the dictation of Kåñëa. The following of Kåñëa’s dictation is real
yoga, and this is practiced in the process called Kåñëa consciousness. By Kåñëa
consciousness only can one give up the sense of proprietorship. One has to
become the servant of Kåñëa, or the servant of the servant of Kåñëa. That is the
right way to discharge duty in Kåñëa consciousness, which alone can help one to
act in yoga.

Arjuna is a kñatriya, and as such he is participating in the varëäçrama-dharma
institution. It is said in the Viñëu Puraëa that in the varëäçrama-dharma, the
whole aim is to satisfy Viñëu. No one should satisfy himself, as is the rule in
the material world, but one should satisfy Kåñëa. So, unless one satisfies
Kåñëa, one cannot correctly observe the principles of varëäçrama-dharma.
Indirectly, Arjuna was advised to act as Kåñëa told him.

TRANSLATION
O Dhanaïjaya, rid yourself of all fruitive activities by devotional service, and
surrender fully to that consciousness. Those who want to enjoy the fruits of
their work are misers.

PURPORT
One who has actually come to understand one’s constitutional position as the
eternal servitor of the Lord gives up all engagements save working in Kåñëa
consciousness. As already explained, buddhi-yoga means transcendental loving
service to the Lord. Such devotional service is the right course of action for
the living entity. Only misers desire to enjoy the fruit of their own work just
to be further entangled in material bondage. Except for work in Kåñëa
consciousness, all activities are abominable because they continually bind the
worker to the cycle of birth and death. One should therefore never desire to be
the cause of work. Everything should be done in Kåñëa consciousness for the
satisfaction of Kåñëa. Misers do not know how to utilize the assets of riches
which they acquire by good fortune or by hard labor. One should spend all
energies working in Kåñëa consciousness, and that will make one’s life
successful. Like the misers, unfortunate persons do not employ their human
energy in the service of the Lord.

A man engaged in devotional service rids himself of both good and bad actions

work.

PURPORT
Since time immemorial each living entity has accumulated the various reactions
of his good and bad work, As such, he is continuously ignorant of his real
constitutional position. One’s ignorance can be removed by the instruction of
the Bhagavad-gétä which teaches one to surrender unto Lord Çré Kåñëa in all
respects and become liberated from the chained victimization of action and
reaction, birth after birth. Arjuna is therefore advised to act in Kåñëa
consciousness, the purifying process of resultant action.

TRANSLATION
The wise, engaged in devotional service, take refuge in the Lord, and free
themselves from the cycle of birth and death by renouncing the fruits of action
in the material world. In this way they can attain that state beyond all
miseries.

PURPORT
The liberated living entities seek that place where there are no material
miseries. The Bhägavatam says:

samäçritä ye padapallava-plavaà
mahat-padaà puëya-yaço muräreù
bhävambudhir vatsa-padaà paraà padaà
paraà padaà yad vipadäà na teñäm

(Bhäg. 10.14.58)

“For one who has accepted the boat of the lotus feet of the Lord, who is the
shelter of the cosmic manifestation and is famous as Mukunda or the giver of
mukti, the ocean of the material world is like the water contained in a calf’s
hoofprint. Param padam, or the place where there are no material miseries, or
Vaikuëöha, is his goal, not the place where there is danger in every step of
life.”

Owing to ignorance, one does not know that this material world is a miserable
place where there are dangers at every step. Out of ignorance only, less
intelligent persons try to adjust to the situation by fruitive activities,
thinking that resultant actions will make them happy. They do not know that no
kind of material body anywhere within the universe can give life without
miseries. The miseries of life, namely birth, death, old age and diseases, are
present everywhere within the material world. But one who understands his real
constitutional position as the eternal servitor of the Lord, and thus knows the
position of the Personality of Godhead, engages himself in the transcendental
loving service of the Lord. Consequently he becomes qualified to enter into the
Vaikuëöha planets, where there is neither material, miserable life, nor the
influence of time and death. To know one’s constitutional position means to know
also the sublime position of the Lord. One who wrongly thinks that the living
entity’s position and the Lord’s position are on the same level is to be
understood to be in darkness and therefore unable to engage himself in the
devotional service of the Lord. He becomes a lord himself and thus paves the way
for the repetition of birth and death. But one who, understanding that his
position is to serve, transfers himself to the service of the Lord, at once
becomes eligible for Vaikuëöhaloka. Service for the cause of the Lord is called
karma-yoga or buddhi-yoga, or in plain words, devotional service to the Lord.

TRANSLATION
When your intelligence has passed out of the dense forest of delusion, you shall

PURPORT
There are many good examples in the lives of the great devotees of the Lord of
those who became indifferent to the rituals of the Vedas simply by devotional
service to the Lord. When a person factually understands Kåñëa and his
relationship with Kåñëa, he naturally becomes completely indifferent to the
rituals of fruitive activities, even though an experienced brähmaëa. Çré
Mädhavendra Puré, a great devotee and äcärya in the line of the devotees, says:

sandhyä-vandana bhadram astu bhavato bhoù snäna tubhyaà namo
bho deväù pitaraç ca tarpaëa-vidhau nähaà kñamaù kñamyatäm
yatra kväpi niñadya yädava-kulottamasya kaàsa-dviñaù
smäraà smäram aghaà harämi tad alaà manye kim anyena me.

“O Lord, in my prayers three times a day, all glory to You. Bathing, I offer my
obeisances unto You. O demigods! O forefathers! Please excuse me for my
inability to offer you my respects. Now wherever I sit, I can remember the great
descendant of the Yadu dynasty [Kåñëa], the enemy of Kaàsa, and thereby I can
free myself from all sinful bondage. I think this is sufficient for me.”

The Vedic rites and rituals are imperative for neophytes: comprehending all
kinds of prayer three times a day, taking a bath early in the morning, offering
respects to the forefathers, etc. But, when one is fully in Kåñëa consciousness
and is engaged in His transcendental loving service, one becomes indifferent to
all these regulative principles because he has already attained perfection. If
one can reach the platform of understanding by service to the Supreme Lord
Kåñëa, he has no longer to execute different types of penances and sacrifices as
recommended in revealed scriptures. And, similarly, if one has not understood
that the purpose of the Vedas is to reach Kåñëa and simply engages in the
rituals, etc., then he is uselessly wasting time in such engagements. Persons in
Kåñëa consciousness transcend the limit of çabda-brahma, or the range of the
Vedas and Upaniñads.

TRANSLATION
When your mind is no longer disturbed by the flowery language of the Vedas, and
when it remains fixed in the trance of self-realization, then you will have
attained the Divine consciousness.

PURPORT
To say that one is in samädhi is to say that one has fully realized Kåñëa
consciousness; that is, one in full samädhi has realized Brahman, Paramätmä and
Bhagavän. The highest perfection of self-realization is to understand that one
is eternally the servitor of Kåñëa and that one’s only business is to discharge
one’s duties in Kåñëa consciousness. A Kåñëa conscious person, or unflinching
devotee of the Lord, should not be disturbed by the flowery language of the
Vedas nor be engaged in fruitive activities for promotion to the heavenly
kingdom. In Kåñëa consciousness, one comes directly into communion with Kåñëa,
and thus all directions from Kåñëa may be understood in that transcendental
state. One is sure to achieve results by such activities and attain conclusive
knowledge. One has only to carry out the orders of Kåñëa or His representative,
the spiritual master.

Transcendence? How does he speak, and what is his language? How does he sit, and
how does he walk?

PURPORT
As there are symptoms for each and every man, in terms of his particular
situation, similarly one who is Kåñëa conscious has his particular
nature—talking, walking, thinking, feeling, etc. As a rich man has his symptoms
by which he is known as a rich man, as a diseased man has his symptoms, by which
he is known as diseased, or as a learned man has his symptoms, so a man in
transcendental consciousness of Kåñëa has specific symptoms in various dealings.
One can know his specific symptoms from the Bhagavad-gétä. Most important is how
the man in Kåñëa consciousness speaks, for speech is the most important quality
of any man. It is said that a fool is undiscovered as long as he does not speak,
and certainly a well-dressed fool cannot be identified unless he speaks, but as
soon as he speaks, he reveals himself at once. The immediate symptom of a Kåñëa
conscious man is that he speaks only of Kåñëa and of matters relating to Him.
Other symptoms then automatically follow, as stated below.

yadä—when; kämän—desires for sense gratification; sarvän—of all varieties;
pärtha—O son of Påthä; manaù-gatän—of mental concoction; ätmani—in the pure
state of the soul; eva—certainly; ätmanä—by the purified mind; tuñöaù—satisfied;

TRANSLATION
The Blessed Lord said: O Pärtha, when a man gives up all varieties of sense
desire which arise from mental concoction, and when his mind finds satisfaction
in the self alone, then he is said to be in pure transcendental consciousness.

PURPORT
The Bhägavatam affirms that any person who is fully in Kåñëa consciousness, or
devotional service of the Lord, has all the good qualities of the great sages,
whereas a person who is not so transcendentally situated has no good
qualifications, because he is sure to be taking refuge in his own mental
concoctions. Consequently, it is rightly said herein that one has to give up all
kinds of sense desire manufactured by mental concoction. Artificially, such
sense desires cannot be stopped. But if one is engaged in Kåñëa consciousness,
then, automatically, sense desires subside without extraneous efforts.
Therefore, one has to engage himself in Kåñëa consciousness without hesitation,
for this devotional service will instantly help one on to the platform of
transcendental consciousness. The highly developed soul always remains satisfied
in himself by realizing himself as the eternal servitor of the Supreme Lord.
Such a transcendentally situated person has no sense desires resulting from
petty materialism; rather, he remains always happy in his natural position of
eternally serving the Supreme Lord.

TRANSLATION
One who is not disturbed in spite of the threefold miseries, who is not elated
when there is happiness, and who is free from attachment, fear and anger, is
called a sage of steady mind.

PURPORT
The word muni means one who can agitate his mind in various ways for mental
speculation without coming to a factual conclusion. It is said that every muni
has a different angle of vision, and unless a muni differs from other munis, he
cannot be called a muni in the strict sense of the term. Näsau munir yasya mataà
na binnam. But a sthita-dhé-muni as mentioned herein by the Lord, is different
from an ordinary muni The sthita-dhé-muni is always in Kåñëa consciousness, for
he has exhausted all his business of creative speculation. He has surpassed the
stage of mental speculations and has come to the conclusion that Lord Çré Kåñëa,
or Väsudeva, is everything. He is called a muni fixed in mind. Such a fully
Kåñëa conscious person is not at all disturbed by the onslaughts of the
threefold miseries, for he accepts all miseries as the mercy of the Lord,
thinking himself only worthy of more trouble due to his past misdeeds; and he
sees that his miseries, by the grace of the Lord, are minimized to the lowest.
Similarly, when he is happy he gives credit to the Lord, thinking himself
unworthy of the happiness; he realizes that it is due only to the Lord’s grace
that he is in such a comfortable condition and able to render better service to
the Lord. And, for the service of the Lord, he is always daring and active and
is not influenced by attachment or aversion. Attachment means accepting things
for one’s own sense gratification, and detachment is the absence of such sensual
attachment. But one fixed in Kåñëa consciousness has neither attachment nor
detachment because his life is dedicated in the service of the Lord.
Consequently he is not at all angry even when his attempts are unsuccessful. A
Kåñëa conscious person is always steady in his determination.

TRANSLATION
He who is without attachment, who does not rejoice when he obtains good, nor
lament when he obtains evil, is firmly fixed in perfect knowledge.

PURPORT
There is always some upheaval in the material world which may be good or evil.
One who is not agitated by such material upheavals, who is unaffected by good
and evil, is to be understood to be fixed in Kåñëa consciousness. As long as one
is in the material world there is always the possibility of good and evil
because this world is full of duality. But one who is fixed in Kåñëa
consciousness is not affected by good and evil because he is simply concerned
with Kåñëa, who is all good absolute. Such consciousness in Kåñëa situates one
in a perfect transcendental position called, technically, samädhi.

TRANSLATION
One who is able to withdraw his senses from sense objects, as the tortoise draws
his limbs within the shell, is to be understood as truly situated in knowledge.

PURPORT
The test of a yogé, devotee, or self-realized soul is that he is able to control
the senses according to his plan. Most people, however, are servants of the
senses and are thus directed by the dictation of the senses. That is the answer
to the question as to how the yogé is situated. The senses are compared to
venomous serpents. They want to act very loosely and without restriction. The
yogé, or the devotee, must be very strong to control the serpents—like a snake
charmer. He never allows them to act independantly. There are many injunctions
in the revealed scriptures; some of them are do-not’s, and some of them are
do’s. Unless one is able to follow the do’s and the do-not’s, restricting
oneself from sense enjoyment, it is not possible to be firmly fixed in Kåñëa
consciousness. The best example, set herein, is the tortoise. The tortoise can
at any moment wind up his senses and exhibit them again at any time for
particular purposes. Similarly, the senses of the Kåñëa conscious persons are
used only for some particular purpose in the service of the Lord and are
withdrawn otherwise. Keeping the senses always in the service of the Lord is the
example set by the analogy of the tortoise, who keeps the senses within.

rasa-varjam—giving up the taste; rasaù—sense of enjoyment; api—although there

TRANSLATION
The embodied soul may be restricted from sense enjoyment, though the taste for
sense objects remains. But, ceasing such engagements by experiencing a higher
taste, he is fixed in consciousness.

PURPORT
Unless one is transcendentally situated, it is not possible to cease from sense
enjoyment. The process of restriction from sense enjoyment by rules and
regulations is something like restricting a diseased person from certain types
of eatables. The patient, however, neither likes such restrictions, nor loses
his taste for eatables. Similarly, sense restriction by some spiritual process
like añöäìga-yoga, in the matter of yama, niyama, äsana, präëäyäma, pratyähära,
dharaëä, dhyäna, etc., is recommended for less intelligent persons who have no
better knowledge. But one who has tasted the beauty of the Supreme Lord Kåñëa,
in the course of his advancement in Kåñëa consciousness, no longer has a taste
for dead material things. Therefore, restrictions are there for the less
intelligent neophytes in the spiritual advancement of life, but such
restrictions are only good if one actually has a taste for Kåñëa consciousness.
When one is actually Kåñëa conscious, he automatically loses his taste for pale
things.

indriyäëi—the senses; pramäthéni—stimulated; haranti—throws forcefully;

TRANSLATION
The senses are so strong and impetuous, O Arjuna, that they forcibly carry away
the mind even of a man of discrimination who is endeavoring to control them.

PURPORT
There are many learned sages, philosophers and transcendentalists who try to
conquer the senses, but in spite of their endeavors, even the greatest of them
sometimes fall victim to material sense enjoyment due to the agitated mind. Even
Viçvämitra, a great sage and perfect yogé, was misled by Menakä into sex
enjoyment, although the yogé was endeavoring for sense control with severe types
of penance and yoga practice. And,of course, there are so many similar instances
in the history of the world. Therefore, it is very difficult to control the mind
and the senses without being fully Kåñëa conscious. Without engaging the mind in
Kåñëa, one cannot cease such material engagements. A practical example is given
by Çré Yämunäcärya, a great saint and devotee, who says: “Since my mind has been
engaged in the service of the lotus feet of Lord Kåñëa, and I have been enjoying
an ever new transcendental humor, whenever I think of sex life with a woman, my
face at once turns from it, and I spit at the thought.”

Kåñëa consciousness is such a transcendentally nice thing that automatically
material enjoyment becomes distasteful. It is as if a hungry man had satisfied
his hunger by a sufficient quantity of nutritious eatables. Mahäräja Ambaréña
also conquered a great yogé, Durväsä Muni, simply because his mind was engaged
in Kåñëa consciousness.

TRANSLATION
One who restrains his senses and fixes his consciousness upon Me is known as a
man of steady intelligence.

PURPORT
That the highest conception of yoga perfection is Kåñëa consciousness is clearly
explained in this verse. And, unless one is Kåñëa conscious, it is not at all
possible to control the senses. As cited above, the great sage Durväsä Muni
picked a quarrel with Mahäräja Ambaréña, and Durväsä Muni unnecessarily became
angry out of pride and therefore could not check his senses. On the other hand,
the King, although not as powerful a yogé as the sage, but a devotee of the
Lord, silently tolerated all the sage’s injustices and thereby emerged
victorious. The King was able to control his senses because of the following
qualifications, as mentioned in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam:

sa vai manaù kåñëa-padäravindayor
vacäàsi vaikuëöha-guëänavarëane
karau harer mandira-märjanädiñu

çiro håñékeça-padäbhivandane

“King Ambaréña fixed his mind on the lotus feet of Lord Kåñëa, engaged his words
in describing the abode of the Lord, his hands in cleansing the temple of the
Lord, his ears in hearing the pastimes of the Lord, his eyes in seeing the form
of the Lord, his body in touching the body of the devotee, his nostrils in
smelling the flavor of the flowers offered to the lotus feet of the Lord, his
tongue in tasting the tulasé leaves offered to Him, his legs in traveling to the
holy place where His temple is situated, his head in offering obeisances unto
the Lord, and his desires in fulfilling the desires of the Lord … and all these
qualifications made him fit to become a mat-paraù devotee of the Lord.” (Bhäg.
9.4.18-20)

The word mat-paraù is most significant in this connection. How one can become a
mat-paraù is described in the life of Mahäräja Ambaréña. Çréla Baladeva
Vidyäbhüñaëa, a great scholar and äcärya in the line of the mat-paraù, remarks:
“mad-bhakti-prabhävena sarvendriya-vijaya-pürvikä svätma dåñöiù sulabheti
bhävaù.” “The senses can be completely controlled only by the strength of
devotional service to Kåñëa.” Also the example of fire is sometimes given: “As
the small flames within burn everything within the room, similarly Lord Viñëu,
situated in the heart of the yogé, burns up all kinds of impurities.” The
Yoga-sütra also prescribes meditation on Viñëu, and not meditation on the void.
The so-called yogés who meditate on something which is not the Viñëu form simply
waste their time in a vain search after some phantasmagoria. We have to be Kåñëa
conscious—devoted to the Personality of Godhead. This is the aim of the real
yoga.

TRANSLATION
While contemplating the objects of the senses, a person develops attachment for
them, and from such attachment lust develops, and from lust anger arises.

PURPORT
One who is not Kåñëa conscious is subjected to material desires while
contemplating the objects of senses. The senses require real engagements, and if
they are not engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, they will
certainly seek engagement in the service of materialism. In the material world
everyone, including Lord Çiva and Lord Brahmä—to say nothing of other demigods
in the heavenly planets—is subjected to the influence of sense objects, and the
only method to get out of this puzzle of material existence is to become Kåñëa
conscious. Lord Çiva was deep in meditation, but when Pärvaté agitated him for
sense pleasure, he agreed to the proposal, and as a result Kärtikeya was born.
When Haridäsa Öhäkur was a young devotee of the Lord, he was similarly allured
by the incarnation of Mäyä Devé, but Haridäsa easily passed the test because of
his unalloyed devotion to Lord Kåñëa. As illustrated in the above-mentioned
verse of Çré Yämunäcärya, a sincere devotee of the Lord shuns all material sense
enjoyment due to his higher taste for spiritual enjoyment in the association of
the Lord. That is the secret of success. One who is not, therefore, in Kåñëa
consciousness, however powerful he may be in controlling the senses by
artificial repression, is sure ultimately to fail, for the slightest thought of
sense pleasure will agitate him to gratify his desires.

TRANSLATION
From anger, delusion arises, and from delusion bewilderment of memory. When
memory is bewildered, intelligence is lost, and when intelligence is lost, one
falls down again into the material pool.

PURPORT
By development of Kåñëa consciousness one can know that everything has its use
in the service of the Lord. Those who are without knowledge of Kåñëa
consciousness artificially try to avoid material objects, and as a result,
although they desire liberation from material bondage, they do not attain to the
perfect stage of renunciation. On the other hand, a person in Kåñëa
consciousness knows how to use everything in the service of the Lord; therefore
he does not become a victim of material consciousness. For example, for an
impersonalist, the Lord, or the Absolute, being impersonal, cannot eat. Whereas
an impersonalist tries to avoid good eatables, a devotee knows that Kåñëa is the
supreme enjoyer and that He eats all that is offered to Him in devotion. So,
after offering good eatables to the Lord, the devotee takes the remnants, called
prasädam. Thus everything becomes spiritualized and there is no danger of a
downfall. The devotee takes prasädam in Kåñëa consciousness, whereas the
nondevotee rejects it as material. The impersonalist, therefore, cannot enjoy
life due to his artificial renunciation; and for this reason, a slight agitation
of the mind pulls him down again into the pool of material existence. It is said
that such a soul, even though rising up to the point of liberation, falls down
again due to his not having support in devotional service.

TRANSLATION
One who can control his senses by practicing the regulated principles of freedom
can obtain the complete mercy of the Lord and thus become free from all
attachment and aversion.

PURPORT
It is already explained that one may externally control the senses by some
artificial process, but unless the senses are engaged in the transcendental
service of the Lord, there is every chance of a fall. Although the person in
full Kåñëa consciousness may apparently be on the sensual plane, because of his
being Kåñëa conscious, he has no attachment to sensual activities. The Kåñëa
conscious person is concerned only with the satisfaction of Kåñëa, and nothing
else. Therefore he is transcendental to all attachment. If Kåñëa wants, the
devotee can do anything which is ordinarily undesirable; and if Kåñëa does not
want, he shall not do that which he would have ordinarily done for his own
satisfaction. Therefore to act or not to act is within his control because he
acts only under the direction of Kåñëa. This consciousness is the causeless
mercy of the Lord, which the devotee can achieve in spite of his being attached
to the sensual platform.

TRANSLATION
One who is not in transcendental consciousness can have neither a controlled
mind nor steady intelligence, without which there is no possibility of peace.
And how can there be any happiness without peace?

PURPORT
Unless one is in Kåñëa consciousness, there is no possibility of peace. So it is
confirmed in the Fifth Chapter (5.29) that when one understands that Kåñëa is
the only enjoyer of all the good results of sacrifice and penance, and that He
is the proprietor of all universal manifestations, that He is the real friend of
all living entities, then only can one have real peace. Therefore, if one is not
in Kåñëa consciousness, there cannot be a final goal for the mind. Disturbance
is due to want of an ultimate goal, and when one is certain that Kåñëa is the
enjoyer, proprietor and friend of everyone and everything, then one can, with a
steady mind, bring about peace. Therefore, one who is engaged without a
relationship with Kåñëa is certainly always in distress and is without peace,
however much one may make a show of peace and spiritual advancement in life.
Kåñëa consciousness is a self-manifested peaceful condition which can be
achieved only in relationship with Kåñëa.

TRANSLATION
As a boat on the water is swept away by a strong wind, even one of the senses on
which the mind focuses can carry away a man’s intelligence.

PURPORT
Unless all of the senses are engaged in the service of the Lord, even one of
them engaged in sense gratification can deviate the devotee from the path of
transcendental advancement. As mentioned in the life of Mahäräja Ambaréña, all
of the senses must be engaged in Kåñëa consciousness, for that is the correct
technique for controlling the mind.

Therefore, O mighty-armed, one whose senses are restrained from their objects is
certainly of steady intelligence.

PURPORT
As enemies are curbed by superior force, similarly, the senses can be curbed not
by any human endeavor, but only by keeping them engaged in the service of the
Lord. One who has understood this—that only by Kåñëa consciousness is one really
established in intelligence and that one should practice this art under the
guidance of a bona fide spiritual master—is called sädhaka, or a suitable
candidate for liberation.

PURPORT
There are two classes of intelligent men. The one is intelligent in material
activities for sense gratification, and the other is introspective and awake to
the cultivation of self-realization. Activities of the introspective sage, or
thoughtful man, are night for persons materially absorbed. Materialistic persons
remain asleep in such a night due to their ignorance of self-realization. The
introspective sage remains alert in the “night” of the materialistic men. The
sage feels transcendental pleasure in the gradual advancement of spiritual
culture, whereas the man in materialistic activities, being asleep to
self-realization, dreams of varieties of sense pleasure, feeling sometimes happy
and sometimes distressed in his sleeping condition. The introspective man is
always indifferent to materialistic happiness and distress. He goes on with his
self-realization activities undisturbed by material reaction.

TRANSLATION
A person who is not disturbed by the incessant flow of desires—that enter like
rivers into the ocean which is ever being filled but is always still—can alone
achieve peace, and not the man who strives to satisfy such desires.

PURPORT
Although the vast ocean is always filled with water, it is always, especially
during the rainy season, being filled with much more water. But the ocean
remains the same—steady; it is not agitated, nor does it cross beyond the limit
of its brink. That is also true of a person fixed in Kåñëa consciousness. As
long as one has the material body, the demands of the body for sense
gratification will continue. The devotee, however, is not disturbed by such
desires because of his fullness. A Kåñëa conscious man is not in need of
anything because the Lord fulfills all his material necessities. Therefore he is
like the ocean—always full in himself. Desires may come to him like the waters
of the rivers that flow into the ocean, but he is steady in his activities, and
he is not even slightly disturbed by desires for sense gratification. That is
the proof of a Kåñëa conscious man—one who has lost all inclinations for
material sense gratification, although the desires are present. Because he
remains satisfied in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, he can
remain steady, like the ocean, and therefore enjoy full peace. Others, however,
who fulfill desires even up to the limit of liberation, what to speak of
material success, never attain peace. The fruitive workers, the salvationists,
and also the yogés who are after mystic powers, are all unhappy because of
unfulfilled desires. But the person in Kåñëa consciousness is happy in the
service of the Lord, and he has no desires to be fulfilled. In fact, he does not
even desire liberation from the so-called material bondage. The devotees of
Kåñëa have no material desires, and therefore they are in perfect peace.

TRANSLATION
A person who has given up all desires for sense gratification, who lives free
from desires, who has given up all sense of proprietorship and is devoid of
false ego—he alone can attain real peace.

PURPORT
To become desireless means not to desire anything for sense gratification. In
other words, desire for becoming Kåñëa conscious is actually desirelessness. To
understand one’s actual position as the eternal servitor of Kåñëa, without
falsely claiming this material body to be oneself and without falsely claiming
proprietorship over anything in the world, is the perfect stage of Kåñëa
consciousness. One who is situated in this perfect stage knows that because
Kåñëa is the proprietor of everything, therefore everything must be used for the
satisfaction of Kåñëa. Arjuna did not want to fight for his own sense
satisfaction, but when he became fully Kåñëa conscious he fought because Kåñëa
wanted him to fight. For himself there was no desire to fight, but for Kåñëa the
same Arjuna fought to his best ability. Desire for the satisfaction of Kåñëa is
really desirelessness; it is not an artificial attempt to abolish desires. The
living entity cannot be desireless or senseless, but he does have to change the
quality of the desires. A materially desireless person certainly knows that
everything belongs to Kåñëa (éçäväsyam idaà sarvam), and therefore he does not
falsely claim proprietorship over anything. This transcendental knowledge is
based on self-realization—namely, knowing perfectly well that every living
entity is the eternal part and parcel of Kåñëa in spiritual identity. and
therefore the eternal position of the living entity is never on the level of
Kåñëa or greater than Him. This understanding of Kåñëa consciousness is the
basic principle of real peace.

TRANSLATION
That is the way of the spiritual and godly life, after attaining which a man is
not bewildered. Being so situated, even at the hour of death, one can enter into
the kingdom of God.

PURPORT
One can attain Kåñëa consciousness or divine life at once, within a second—or
one may not attain such a state of life even after millions of births. It is
only a matter of understanding and accepting the fact. Khaöväìga Mahäräja
attained this state of life just a few minutes before his death, by surrendering
unto Kåñëa. Nirväëa means ending the process of materialistic life. According to
Buddhist philosophy, there is only void after the completion of this material
life, but Bhagavad-gétä teaches differently. Actual life begins after the
completion of this material life. For the gross materialist it is sufficient to
know that one has to end this materialistic way of life, but for persons who are
spiritually advanced, there is another life after this materialistic life.
Before ending this life, if one fortunately becomes Kåñëa conscious, he at once
attains the stage of Brahma-nirväëa. There is no difference between the kingdom
of God and the devotional service of the Lord. Since both of them are on the
absolute plane, to be engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord
is to have attained the spiritual kingdom. In the material world there are
activities of sense gratification, whereas in the spiritual world there are
activities of Kåñëa consciousness. Attainment of Kåñëa consciousness even during
this life is immediate attainment of Brahman, and one who is situated in Kåñëa
consciousness has certainly already entered into the kingdom of God.

Brahman is just the opposite of matter. Therefore brähmé sthitiù means “not on
the platform of material activities.” Devotional service of the Lord is accepted
in the Bhagavad-gétä as the liberated stage. Therefore, brähmé-sthitiù is
liberation from material bondage.

Çréla Bhaktivinode Öhäkur has summarized this Second Chapter of the
Bhagavad-gétä as being the contents for the whole text. In the Bhagavad-gétä,
the subject matters are karma-yoga, jïäna-yoga, and bhakti-yoga. In the Second
Chapter karma-yoga and jïäna-yoga have been clearly discussed, and a glimpse of
bhakti-yoga has also been given, as the contents for the complete text.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Second Chapter of the
Çrémad-Bhagavad-gétä in the matter of its Contents.

TRANSLATION
Arjuna said: O Janärdana, O Keçava, why do You urge me to engage in this ghastly
warfare, if You think that intelligence is better than fruitive work?

PURPORT
The Supreme Personality of Godhead Çré Kåñëa has very elaborately described the
constitution of the soul in the previous chapter, with a view to deliver His
intimate friend Arjuna from the ocean of material grief. And the path of
realization has been recommended: buddhi-yoga, or Kåñëa consciousness. Sometimes
Kåñëa consciousness is misunderstood to be inertia, and one with such a
misunderstanding often withdraws to a secluded place to become fully Kåñëa
conscious by chanting the holy name of Lord Kåñëa. But without being trained in
the philosophy of Kåñëa consciousness, it is not advisable to chant the holy
name of Kåñëa in a secluded place where one may acquire only cheap adoration
from the innocent public. Arjuna also thought of Kåñëa consciousness or
buddhi-yoga, or intelligence in spiritual advancement of knowledge, as something
like retirement from active life and the practice of penance and austerity at a
secluded place. In other words, he wanted to skillfully avoid the fighting by
using Kåñëa consciousness as an excuse. But as a sincere student, he placed the
matter before his master and questioned Kåñëa as to his best course of action.
In answer, Lord Kåñëa elaborately explained karma-yoga, or work in Kåñëa
consciousness, in this Third Chapter.

TRANSLATION
My intelligence is bewildered by Your equivocal instructions. Therefore, please

PURPORT
In the previous chapter, as a prelude to the Bhagavad-gétä, many different paths
were explained, such as säìkhya-yoga, buddhi-yoga, control of the senses by
intelligence, work without fruitive desire, and the position of the neophyte.
This was all presented unsystematically. A more organized outline of the path
would be necessary for action and understanding. Arjuna, therefore, wanted to
clear up these apparently confusing matters so that any common man could accept
them without misinterpretation. Although Kåñëa had no intention of confusing
Arjuna by any jugglery of words, Arjuna could not follow the process of Kåñëa
consciousness—either by inertia or active service. In other words, by his
questions he is clearing the path of Kåñëa consciousness for all students who
seriously want to understand the mystery of the Bhagavad-gétä.

TRANSLATION
The Blessed Lord said: O sinless Arjuna, I have already explained that there are
two classes of men who realize the Self. Some are inclined to understand Him by
empirical, philosophical speculation, and others are inclined to know Him by
devotional work.

PURPORT
In the Second Chapter, verse 39, the Lord explained two kinds of
procedures—namely säìkhya-yoga and karma-yoga, or buddhi-yoga. In this verse,
the Lord explains the same more clearly. Säìkhya-yoga, or the analytical study
of the nature of spirit and matter, is the subject matter for persons who are
inclined to speculate and understand things by experimental knowledge and
philosophy. The other class of men work in Kåñëa consciousness, as it is
explained in the 61st verse of the Second Chapter. The Lord has explained, also
in the 39th verse, that by working by the principles of buddhi-yoga, or Kåñëa
consciousness, one can be relieved from the bonds of action; and, furthermore,
there is no flaw in the process. The same principle is more clearly explained in
the 61st verse—that this buddhi-yoga is to depend entirely on the Supreme (or
more specifically, on Kåñëa), and in this way all the senses can be brought
under control very easily. Therefore, both the yogas are interdependant, as
religion and philosophy. Religion without philosophy is sentiment, or sometimes
fanaticism, while philosophy without religion is mental speculation. The
ultimate goal is Kåñëa, because the philosophers who are also sincerely
searching after the Absolute Truth come in the end to Kåñëa consciousness. This
is also stated in the Bhagavad-gétä. The whole process is to understand the real
position of the self in relation to the Superself. The indirect process is
philosophical speculation, by which, gradually, one may come to the point of
Kåñëa consciousness; and the other process is directly connecting with
everything in Kåñëa consciousness. Of these two, the path of Kåñëa consciousness
is better because it does not depend on purifying the senses by a philosophical
process. Kåñëa consciousness is itself the purifying process, and by the direct
method of devotional service it is simultaneously easy and sublime.

TRANSLATION
Not by merely abstaining from work can one achieve freedom from reaction, nor by
renunciation alone can one attain perfection.

PURPORT
The renounced order of life can be accepted upon being purified by the discharge
of the prescribed form of duties which are laid down just to purify the heart of
materialistic men. Without purification, one cannot attain success by abruptly
adopting the fourth order of life (sannyäsa). According to the empirical
philosophers, simply by adopting sannyäsa, or retiring from fruitive activities,
one at once becomes as good as Näräyaëa. But Lord Kåñëa does not approve this
principle. Without purification of heart, sannyäsa is simply a disturbance to
the social order. On the other hand, if someone takes to the transcendental
service of the Lord, even without discharging his prescribed duties, whatever he
may be able to advance in the cause is accepted by the Lord (buddhi-yoga).
Svalpam apy asya dharmasya träyate mahato bhayät. Even a slight performance of
such a principle enables one to overcome great difficulties.


TEXT 5

tiñöhati—stands; akarma-kåt—without doing something; käryate—is forced to do;
hi—certainly; avaçaù—helplessly; karma—work; sarvaù—everything; prakåti-jaiù—out

TRANSLATION
All men are forced to act helplessly according to the impulses born of the modes
of material nature; therefore no one can refrain from doing something, not even
for a moment.

PURPORT
It is not a question of embodied life, but it is the nature of the soul to be
always active. Without the presence of the spirit soul, the material body cannot
move. The body is only a dead vehicle to be worked by the spirit soul, which is
always active and cannot stop even for a moment. As such, the spirit soul has to
be engaged in the good work of Kåñëa consciousness, otherwise it will be engaged
in occupations dictated by illusory energy. In contact with material energy, the
spirit soul acquires material modes, and to purify the soul from such affinities
it is necessary to engage in the prescribed duties enjoined in the çästras. But
if the soul is engaged in his natural function of Kåñëa consciousness, whatever
he is able to do is good for him. The Çrémad-Bhägavatam affirms this:

tyaktvä sva-dharmaà caraëämbujaà harer
bhajann apakvo ’tha patet tato yadi
yatra kva väbhadram abhüd amuñya kià
ko värtha äpto ’bhajatäà sva-dharmataù.

“If someone takes to Kåñëa consciousness, even though he may not follow the
prescribed duties in the çästras nor execute the devotional service properly,
and even though he may fall down from the standard, there is no loss or evil for
him. But if he carries out all the injunctions for purification in the çästras,
what does it avail him if he is not Kåñëa conscious?” (Bhäg. 1.5.17) So the
purificatory process is necessary for reaching this point of Kåñëa
consciousness. Therefore, sannyäsa, or any purificatory process, is to help
reach the ultimate goal of becoming Kåñëa conscious, without which everything is
considered a failure.

TRANSLATION
One who restrains the senses and organs of action, but whose mind dwells on
sense objects, certainly deludes himself and is called a pretender.

PURPORT
There are many pretenders who refuse to work in Kåñëa consciousness but make a
show of meditation, while actually dwelling within the mind upon sense
enjoyment. Such pretenders may also speak on dry philosophy in order to bluff
sophisticated followers, but according to this verse these are the greatest
cheaters. For sense enjoyment one can act in any capacity of the social order,
but if one follows the rules and regulations of his particular status, he can
make gradual progress in purifying his existence. But he who makes a show of
being a yogé, while actually searching for the objects of sense gratification,
must be called the greatest cheater, even though he sometimes speaks of
philosophy. His knowledge has no value because the effects of such a sinful
man’s knowledge are taken away by the illusory energy of the Lord. Such a
pretender’s mind is always impure, and therefore his show of yogic meditation
has no value whatsoever.

TRANSLATION
On the other hand, he who controls the senses by the mind and engages his active
organs in works of devotion, without attachment, is by far superior.

PURPORT
Instead of becoming a pseudo-transcendentalist for the sake of wanton living and
sense enjoyment, it is far better to remain in one’s own business and execute
the purpose of life, which is to get free from material bondage and enter into
the kingdom of God. The prime svärtha-gati, or goal of self-interest, is to
reach Viñëu. The whole institution of varëa and äçrama is designed to help us
reach this goal of life. A householder can also reach this destination by
regulated service in Kåñëa consciousness. For self-realization, one can live a
controlled life, as prescribed in the çästras, and continue carrying out his
business without attachment, and in that way make progress. Such a sincere
person who follows this method is far better situated than the false pretender
who adopts show-bottle spiritualism to cheat the innocent public. A sincere
sweeper in the street is far better than the charlatan meditator who meditates
only for the sake of making a living.

TRANSLATION
Perform your prescribed duty, for action is better than inaction. A man cannot
even maintain his physical body without work.

PURPORT
There are many pseudo-meditators who misrepresent themselves as belonging to
high parentage, and great professional men who falsely pose that they have
sacrificed everything for the sake of advancement in spiritual life. Lord Kåñëa
did not want Arjuna to become a pretender, but that he perform his prescribed
duties as set forth for kñatriyas. Arjuna was a householder and a military
general, and therefore it was better for him to remain as such and perform his
religious duties as prescribed for the householder kñatriya. Such activities
gradually cleanse the heart of a mundane man and free him from material
contamination. So-called renunciation for the purpose of maintenance is never
approved by the Lord, nor by any religious scripture. After all, one has to
maintain one’s body and soul together by some work. Work should not be given up
capriciously, without purification of materialistic propensities. Anyone who is
in the material world is certainly possessed of the impure propensity for
lording it over material nature, or, in other words, for sense gratification.
Such polluted propensities have to be cleared. Without doing so, through
prescribed duties, one should never attempt to become a so-called
transcendentalist, renouncing work and living at the cost of others.

TRANSLATION
Work done as a sacrifice for Viñëu has to be performed, otherwise work binds one
to this material world. Therefore, O son of Kunté, perform your prescribed
duties for His satisfaction, and in that way you will always remain unattached
and free from bondage.

PURPORT
Since one has to work even for the simple maintenance of the body, the
prescribed duties for a particular social position and quality are so made that
that purpose can be fulfilled. Yajïa means Lord Viñëu, or sacrificial
performances. All sacrificial performances also are meant for the satisfaction
of Lord Viñëu. The Vedas enjoin: yajïo vai viñëuù. In other words, the same
purpose is served whether one performs prescribed yajïas or directly serves Lord
Viñëu. Kåñëa consciousness is therefore performance of yajïa as it is prescribed
in this verse. The varëäçrama institution also aims at this for satisfying Lord
Viñëu. “Varëäçramäcära-vatä puruñeëa paraù pumän/viñëur ärädhyate…” (Viñëu
Puräëa 3.8.8) Therefore one has to work for the satisfaction of Viñëu. Any other
work done in this material world wilI be a cause of bondage, for both good and
evil work have their reactions, and any reaction binds the performer. Therefore,
one has to work in Kåñëa consciousness to satisfy Kåñëa (or Viñëu); and while
performing such activities one is in a liberated stage. This is the great art of
doing work, and in the beginning this process requires very expert guidance. One
should therefore act very diligently, under the expert guidance of a devotee of
Lord Kåñëa, or under the direct instruction of Lord Kåñëa Himself (under whom
Arjuna had the opportunity to work). Nothing should be performed for sense
gratification, but everything should be done for the satisfaction of Kåñëa. This
practice will not only save one from the reaction of work, but will also
gradually elevate one to transcendental loving service of the Lord, which alone
can raise one to the kingdom of God.

TRANSLATION
In the beginning of creation, the Lord of all creatures sent forth generations
of men and demigods, along with sacrifices for Viñëu, and blessed them by
saying, “Be thou happy by this yajïa [sacrifice] because its performance will
bestow upon you all desirable things.”

PURPORT
The material creation by the Lord of creatures (Viñëu) is a chance offered to
the conditioned souls to come back home—back to Godhead. All living entities
within the material creation are conditioned by material nature because of their
forgetfulness of their relationship to Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. The Vedic principles are to help us understand this eternal relation as
it is stated in the Bhagavad-gétä: vedaiç ca sarvair aham eva vedyaù. The Lord
says that the purpose of the Vedas is to understand Him. In the Vedic hymns it
is said: patià viçvasyätmeçvaram. Therefore, the Lord of the living entities is
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viñëu. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam also Çréla
Çukadeva Gosvämé describes the Lord as pati in so many ways:

çriyaù-patir yajïa-patiù prajä-patir
dhiyäà patir loka-patir dharä-patiù
patir gatiç cändhaka-våñëi-sätvatäà
prasédatäà me bhagavän satäà patiù

(Bhäg. 2.4.20)

The prajä-pati is Lord Viñëu, and He is the Lord of all living creatures, all
worlds, and all beauties, and the protector of everyone. The Lord created this
material world for the conditioned souls to learn how to perform yajïas
(sacrifice) for the satisfaction of Viñëu, so that while in the material world
they can live very comfortably without anxiety. Then after finishing the present
material body, they can enter into the kingdom of God. That is the whole program
for the conditioned soul. By performance of yajïa, the conditioned souls
gradually become Kåñëa conscious and become godly in all respects. In this age
of Kali, the saìkértana-yajïa (the chanting of the names of God) is recommended
by the Vedic scriptures, and this transcendental system was introduced by Lord
Caitanya for the deliverance of all men in this age. Saìkértana-yajïa and Kåñëa
consciousness go well together. Lord Kåñëa in His devotional form (as Lord
Caitanya) is mentioned in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam as follows, with special
reference to the saìkértana-yajïa:

kåñëa-varëaà tviñäkåñëäà säìgopäìgästra-pärñadam
yajïaiù saìkértana-präyair yajanti hi su-medhasaù

“In this age of Kali, people who are endowed with sufficient intelligence will
worship the Lord, who is accompanied by His associates, by performance of
saìkértana-yajïa.” (Bhäg. 11.5.29) Other yajïas prescribed in the Vedic
literatures are not easy to perform in this age of Kali, but the
saìkértana-yajïa is easy and sublime for all purposes.

TRANSLATION
The demigods, being pleased by sacrifices, will also please you; thus nourishing
one another, there will reign general prosperity for all.

PURPORT
The demigods are empowered administrators of material affairs. The supply of
air, light, water and all other benedictions for maintaining the body and soul
of every living entity are entrusted to the demigods, who are innumerable
assistants in different parts of the body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Their pleasures and displeasures are dependant on the performance of yajïas by
the human being. Some of the yajïas are meant to satisfy particular demigods;
but even in so doing, Lord Viñëu is worshiped in all yajïas as the chief
beneficiary. It is stated also in the Bhagavad-gétä that Kåñëa Himself is the
beneficiary of all kinds of yajïas: bhoktäraà yajïa-tapasäm. Therefore, ultimate
satisfaction of the yajïapati is the chief purpose of all yajïas. When these
yajïas are perfectly performed, naturally the demigods in charge of the
different departments of supply are pleased, and there is no scarcity in the
supply of natural products.

Performance of yajïas has many side benefits, ultimately leading to liberation
from the material bondage. By performance of yajïas, all activities become
purified, as it is stated in the Vedas:

ähära-çuddhau sattva-çuddhiù sattva-çuddhau
dhruvä småtiù småti-lambhe sarva-granthénäà vipra-mokñaù

As it will be explained in the following verse, by performance of yajïa, one’s
eatables become sanctified, and by eating sanctified foodstuffs, one’s very
existence becomes purified; by the purification of existence, finer tissues in
the memory become sanctified, and when memory is sanctified, one can think of
the path of liberation, and all these combined together lead to Kåñëa
consciousness, the great necessity of present-day society.

TRANSLATION
In charge of the various necessities of life, the demigods, being satisfied by
the performance of yajïa [sacrifice], supply all necessities to man. But he who
enjoys these gifts, without offering them to the demigods in return, is
certainly a thief.

PURPORT
The demigods are authorized supplying agents on behalf of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Viñëu. Therefore, they must be satisfied by the
performance of prescribed yajïas. In the Vedas, there are different kinds of
yajïas prescribed for different kinds of demigods, but all are ultimately
offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. For one who cannot understand
what the Personality of Godhead is, sacrifice to the demigods is recommended.
According to the different material qualities of the persons concerned,
different types of yajïas are recommended in the Vedas. Worship of different
demigods is also on the same basis—namely, according to different qualities. For
example, the meat-eaters are recommended to worship the goddess Kälé, the
ghastly form of material nature, and before the goddess the sacrifice of animals
is recommended. But for those who are in the mode of goodness, the
transcendental worship of Viñëu is recommended. But ultimately, all yajïas are
meant for gradual promotion to the transcendental position. For ordinary men, at
least five yajïas, known as païca-mahäyajïa, are necessary.

One should know, however, that all the necessities of life that the human
society requires are supplied by the demigod agents of the Lord. No one can
manufacture anything. Take, for example, all the eatables of human society.
These eatables include grains, fruits, vegetables, milk, sugar, etc., for the
persons in the mode of goodness, and also eatables for the nonvegetarians, like
meats, etc., none of which can be manufactured by men. Then again, take for
example heat, light, water, air, etc., which are also necessities of life—none
of them can be manufactured by the human society. Without the Supreme Lord,
there can be no profuse sunlight, moonlight, rainfall, breeze, etc., without
which no one can live. Obviously, our life is dependant on supplies from the
Lord. Even for our manufacturing enterprises, we require so many raw materials
like metal, sulphur, mercury, manganese, and so many essentials—all of which are
supplied by the agents of the Lord, with the purpose that we should make proper
use of them to keep ourselves fit and healthy for the purpose of
self-realization, leading to the ultimate goal of life, namely, liberation from
the material struggle for existence. This aim of life is attained by performance
of yajïas. If we forget the purpose of human life and simply take supplies from
the agents of the Lord for sense gratification and become more and more
entangled in material existence, which is not the purpose of creation, certainly
we become thieves, and therefore we are punished by the laws of material nature.
A society of thieves can never be happy because they have no aim in life. The
gross materialist thieves have no ultimate goal of life. They are simply
directed to sense gratification; nor do they have knowledge of how to perform
yajïas. Lord Caitanya, however, inaugurated the easiest performance of yajïa,
namely the saìkértana-yajïa, which can be performed by anyone in the world who
accepts the principles of Kåñëa consciousness.

bhuïjate—enjoy; te—they; tu—but; agham—grievous sins; päpäù—sinners; ye—those;

TRANSLATION
The devotees of the Lord are released from all kinds of sins because they eat
food which is offered first for sacrifice. Others, who prepare food for personal
sense enjoyment, verily eat only sin.

PURPORT
The devotees of the Supreme Lord, or the persons who are in Kåñëa consciousness,
are called santas, and they are always in love with the Lord as it is described
in the Brahma-saàhitä: premäïjana- cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santaù sadaiva
hådayeñu vilokayanti. The santas, being always in a compact of love with the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda (the giver of all pleasures), or Mukunda
(the giver of liberation), or Kåñëa (the all-attractive person), cannot accept
anything without first offering it to the Supreme Person. Therefore, such
devotees always perform yajïas in different modes of devotional service, such as
çravaëam, kértanam, smaraëam, arcanam, etc., and these performances of yajïas
keep them always aloof from all kinds of contamination of sinful association in
the material world. Others, who prepare food for self or sense gratification,
are not only thieves, but are also the eaters of all kinds of sins. How can a
person be happy if he is both a thief and sinful? It is not possible. Therefore,
in order for people to become happy in all respects, they must be taught to
perform the easy process of saìkértana-yajïa, in full Kåñëa consciousness.
Otherwise, there can be no peace or happiness in the world.

TRANSLATION
All living bodies subsist on food grains, which are produced from rain. Rains
are produced by performance of yajïa [sacrifice], and yajïa is born of
prescribed duties.

PURPORT
Çréla Baladeva Vidyäbhüñaëa, a great commentator on the Bhagavad-gétä, writes as
follows: ye indrädy-aìga-tayävasthitaà yajïaà sarveçvaraà viñëum abhyarccya
taccheñam açnanti tena taddeha-yänträà sampädayanti te santaù sarveçvarasya
bhaktäù sarva-kilviñair anädi-käla-vivåddhair ätmänubhava- pratibandhakair
nikhilaiù päpair vimucyante. The Supreme Lord, who is known as the
yajïa-puruñaù, or the personal beneficiary of all sacrifices, is the master of
all demigods who serve Him as the different limbs of the body serve the whole.
Demigods like Indra, Candra, Varuëa, etc., are appointed officers who manage
material affairs, and the Vedas direct sacrifices to satisfy these demigods so
that they may be pleased to supply air, light and water sufficiently to produce
food grains. When Lord Kåñëa is worshiped, the demigods, who are different limbs
of the Lord, are also automatically worshiped; therefore there is no separate
need to worship the demigods. For this reason, the devotees of the Lord, who are
in Kåñëa consciousness, offer food to Kåñëa and then eat—a process which
nourishes the body spiritually. By such action not only are past sinful
reactions in the body vanquished, but the body becomes immunized to all
contamination of material nature. When there is an epidemic disease, an
antiseptic vaccine protects a person from the attack of such an epidemic.
Similarly, food offered to Lord Viñëu and then taken by us makes us sufficiently
resistant to material affection, and one who is accustomed to this practice is
called a devotee of the Lord. Therefore, a person in Kåñëa consciousness, who
eats only food offered to Kåñëa, can counteract all reactions of past material
infections, which are impediments to the progress of self-realization. On the
other hand, one who does not do so continues to increase the volume of sinful
action, and this prepares the next body to resemble hogs and dogs, to suffer the
resultant reactions of all sins. The material world is full of contaminations,
and one who is immunized by accepting prasädam of the Lord (food offered to
Viñëu) is saved from the attack, whereas one who does not do so becomes
subjected to contamination.

Food grains or vegetables are factually eatables. The human being eats different
kinds of food grains, vegetables, fruits, etc., and the animals eat the refuse
of the food grains and vegetables, grass, plants, etc. Human beings who are
accustomed to eating meat and flesh must also depend on the production of
vegetation in order to eat the animals. Therefore, ultimately, we have to depend
on the production of the field and not on the production of big factories. The
field production is due to sufficient rain from the sky, and such rains are
controlled by demigods like Indra, sun, moon, etc., and they are all servants of
the Lord. The Lord can be satisfied by sacrifices; therefore, one who cannot
perform them will find himself in scarcity—that is the law of nature. Yajïa,
specifically the saìkértana-yajïa prescribed for this age, must therefore be
performed to save us at least from scarcity of food supply.

TRANSLATION
Regulated activities are prescribed in the Vedas, and the Vedas are directly
manifested from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Consequently the
all-pervading Transcendence is eternally situated in acts of sacrifice.

PURPORT
Yajïärtha karma, or the necessity of work for the satisfaction of Kåñëa only, is
more expressly stated in this verse. If we have to work for the satisfaction of
the yajïa-puruña, Viñëu, then we must find out the direction of work in Brahman,
or the transcendental Vedas. The Vedas are therefore codes of working
directions. Anything performed without the direction of the Vedas is called
vikarma, or unauthorized or sinful work. Therefore, one should always take
direction from the Vedas to be saved from the reaction of work. As one has to
work in ordinary life by the direction of the state, similarly, one has to work
under direction of the supreme state of the Lord. Such directions in the Vedas
are directly manifested from the breathing of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. It is said: asya mahato bhütasya naçvasitam etad yad åg-vedo
yajur-vedaù säma-vedo ’tharväì girasaù. “The four Vedas—namely the Åg-veda,
Yajur-veda, Säma-veda and Atharva-veda—are all emanations from the breathing of
the great Personality of Godhead.” The Lord, being omnipotent, can speak by
breathing air, as it is confirmed in the Brahma-saàhitä, for the Lord has the
omnipotence to perform through each of His senses the actions of all other
senses. In other words, the Lord can speak through His breathing, and He can
impregnate by His eyes. In fact, it is said that He glanced over material nature
and thus fathered all living entities. After creating or impregnating the
conditioned souls into the womb of material nature, He gave His directions in
the Vedic wisdom as to how such conditioned souls can return home, back to
Godhead. We should always remember that the conditioned souls in material nature
are all eager for material enjoyment. But the Vedic directions are so made that
one can satisfy one’s perverted desires, then return to Godhead, having finished
his so-called enjoyment. It is a chance for the conditioned souls to attain
liberation; therefore the conditioned souls must try to follow the process of
yajïa by becoming Kåñëa conscious. Even those who cannot follow the Vedic
injunctions may adopt the principles of Kåñëa consciousness, and that will take
the place of performance of Vedic yajïas, or karmas.

TRANSLATION
My dear Arjuna, a man who does not follow this prescribed Vedic system of
sacrifice certainly leads a life of sin, for a person delighting only in the
senses lives in vain.

PURPORT
The mammonist philosophy of work very hard and enjoy sense gratification is
condemned herein by the Lord. Therefore, for those who want to enjoy this
material world, the above-mentioned cycle of performing yajïas is absolutely
necessary. One who does not follow such regulations is living a very risky life,
being condemned more and more. By nature’s law, this human form of life is
specifically meant for self-realization, in either of the three ways—namely
karma-yoga, jïäna-yoga, or bhakti-yoga. There is no necessity of rigidly
following the performances of the prescribed yajïas for the transcendentalists
who are above vice and virtue; but those who are engaged in sense gratification
require purification by the above-mentioned cycle of yajïa performances. There
are different kinds of activities. Those who are not Kåñëa conscious are
certainly engaged in sensory consciousness; therefore they need to execute pious
work. The yajïa system is planned in such a way that sensory conscious persons
may satisfy their desires without becoming entangled in the reaction of
sense-gratificatory work. The prosperity of the world depends not on our own
efforts but on the background arrangement of the Supreme Lord, directly carried
out by the demigods. Therefore, the yajïas are directly aimed at the particular
demigod mentioned in the Vedas. Indirectly, it is the practice of Kåñëa
consciousness, because when one masters the performance of yajïas, one is sure
to become Kåñëa conscious. But if by performing yajïas one does not become Kåñëa
conscious, such principles are counted as only moral codes. One should not,
therefore, limit his progress only to the point of moral codes, but should
transcend them, to attain Kåñëa consciousness.

TRANSLATION
One who is, however, taking pleasure in the self, who is illumined in the self,
who rejoices in and is satisfied with the self only, fully satiated—for him
there is no duty.

PURPORT
A person who is fully Kåñëa conscious, and is fully satisfied by his acts in
Kåñëa consciousness, no longer has any duty to perform. Due to his being Kåñëa
conscious, all impiety within is instantly cleansed, an effect of many, many
thousands of yajïa performances. By such clearing of consciousness, one becomes
fully confident of his eternal position in relationship with the Supreme. His
duty thus becomes self-illuminated by the grace of the Lord, and therefore he no
longer has any obligations to the Vedic injunctions. Such a Kåñëa conscious
person is no longer interested in material activities and no longer takes
pleasure in material arrangements like wine, women and similar infatuations.

TRANSLATION
A self-realized man has no purpose to fulfill in the discharge of his prescribed
duties, nor has he any reason not to perform such work. Nor has he any need to
depend on any other living being.

PURPORT
A self-realized man is no longer obliged to perform any prescribed duty, save
and except activities in Kåñëa consciousness. Kåñëa consciousness is not
inactivity either, as will be explained in the following verses. A Kåñëa
conscious man does not take shelter of any person—man or demigod. Whatever he
does in Kåñëa consciousness is sufficient in the discharge of his obligation.

TRANSLATION
Therefore, without being attached to the fruits of activities, one should act as
a matter of duty; for by working without attachment, one attains the Supreme.

PURPORT
The Supreme is the Personality of Godhead for the devotees, and liberation for
the impersonalist. A person, therefore, acting for Kåñëa, or in Kåñëa
consciousness, under proper guidance and without attachment to the result of the
work, is certainly making progress toward the supreme goal of life. Arjuna is
told that he should fight in the Battle of Kurukñetra for the interest of Kåñëa
because Kåñëa wanted him to fight. To be a good man or a nonviolent man is a
personal attachment, but to act on behalf of the Supreme is to act without
attachment for the result. That is perfect action of the highest degree,
recommended by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Çré Kåñëa. Vedic rituals,
like prescribed sacrifices, are performed for purification of impious activities
that were performed in the field of sense gratification. But action in Kåñëa
consciousness is transcendental to the reactions of good or evil work. A Kåñëa
conscious person has no attachment for the result but acts on behalf of Kåñëa
alone. He engages in all kinds of activities, but is completely nonattached.

TRANSLATION
Even kings like Janaka and others attained the perfectional stage by performance
of prescribed duties. Therefore, just for the sake of educating the people in
general, you should perform your work.

PURPORT
Kings like Janaka and others were all self-realized souls; consequently they had
no obligation to perform the prescribed duties in the Vedas. Nonetheless they
performed all prescribed activities just to set examples for the people in
general. Janaka was the father of Sétä, and father-in-law of Lord Çré Räma.
Being a great devotee of the Lord, he was transcendentally situated, but because
he was the King of Mithila (a subdivision of Behar province in India), he had to
teach his subjects how to fight righteously in battle. He and his subjects
fought to teach people in general that violence is also necessary in a situation
where good arguments fail. Before the Battle of Kurukñetra, every effort was
made to avoid the war, even by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but the other
party was determined to fight. So for such a right cause, there is a necessity
for fighting. Although one who is situated in Kåñëa consciousness may not have
any interest in the world, he still works to teach the public how to live and
how to act. Experienced persons in Kåñëa consciousness can act in such a way
that others will follow, and this is explained in the following verse.


TEXT 21

lokaù—all the world; tat—that; anuvartate—follow in the footsteps.

TRANSLATION
Whatever action is performed by a great man, common men follow in his footsteps.
And whatever standards he sets by exemplary acts, all the world pursues.

PURPORT
People in general always require a leader who can teach the public by practical
behavior. A leader cannot teach the public to stop smoking if he himself smokes.
Lord Caitanya said that a teacher should behave properly even before he begins
teaching. One who teaches in that way is called äcärya, or the ideal teacher.
Therefore, a teacher must follow the principles of çäçtra (scripture) to reach
the common man. The teacher cannot manufacture rules against the principles of
revealed scriptures. The revealed scriptures, like Manu-saàhitä and similar
others, are considered the standard books to be followed by human society. Thus
the leader’s teaching should be based on the principles of the standard rules as
they are practiced by the great teachers. The Çrémad-Bhägavatam also affirms
that one should follow in the footsteps of great devotees, and that is the way
of progress on the path of spiritual realization. The king or the executive head
of a state, the father and the school teacher are all considered to be natural
leaders of the innocent people in general. All such natural leaders have a great
responsibility to their dependants; therefore they must be conversant with
standard books of moral and spiritual codes.

O son of Påthä, there is no work prescribed for Me within all the three

anything—and yet I am engaged in work.

PURPORT
The Supreme Personality of Godhead is described in the Vedic literatures as
follows:

tam éçvaräëäà paramaà maheçvaraà
taà devatänäà paramaà ca daivatam
patià paténäà paramaà parastäd
vidäma devaà bhuvaneçam éòyam

na tat-samaç cäbhyadhikaç ca dåçyate
paräsya çaktir vividhaiva çrüyate
svä-bhäviké jïäna-bala-kriyä ca.

“The Supreme Lord is the controller of all other controllers, and He is the
greatest of all the diverse planetary leaders. Everyone is under His control.
All entities are delegated with particular power only by the Supreme Lord; they
are not supreme themselves. He is also worshipable by all demigods and is the
supreme director of all directors. Therefore, He is transcendental to all kinds
of material leaders and controllers and is worshipable by all. There is no one
greater than Him, and He is the supreme cause of all causes.

“He does not possess bodily form like that of an ordinary living entity. There
is no difference between His body and His soul. He is absolute. All His senses
are transcendental. Any one of His senses can perform the action of any other
sense. Therefore, no one is greater than Him or equal to Him. His potencies are
multifarious, and thus His deeds are automatically performed as a natural
sequence.” (Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad 6.7–8)

Since everything is in full opulence in the Personality of Godhead and is
existing in full truth, there is no duty for the Supreme Personality of Godhead
to perform. One who must receive the results of work has some designated duty,
but one who has nothing to achieve within the three planetary systems certainly
has no duty. And yet Lord Kåñëa is engaged on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra as
the leader of the kñatriyas because the kñatriyas are duty-bound to give
protection to the distressed. Although He is above all the regulations of the
revealed scriptures, He does not do anything that violates the revealed
scriptures.

For, if I did not engage in work, O Pärtha, certainly all men would follow My

PURPORT
In order to keep the balance of social tranquility for progress in spiritual
life. there are traditional family usages meant for every civilized man.
Although such rules and regulations are for the conditioned souls and not Lord
Kåñëa, because He descended to establish the principles of religion, He followed
the prescribed rules. Otherwise, common men would follow in His footsteps
because He is the greatest authority. From the Çrémad-Bhägavatam it is
understood that Lord Kåñëa was performing all the religious duties at home and
out of home, as required of a householder.

TRANSLATION
If I should cease to work, then all these worlds would be put to ruination. I
would also be the cause of creating unwanted population, and I would thereby
destroy the peace of all sentient beings.

PURPORT
Varëa-saìkara is unwanted population which disturbs the peace of the general
society. In order to check this social disturbance, there are prescribed rules
and regulations by which the population can automatically become peaceful and
organized for spiritual progress in life. When Lord Kåñëa descends, naturally He
deals with such rules and regulations in order to maintain the prestige and
necessity of such important performances. The Lord is the father of all living
entities, and if the living entities are misguided, indirectly the
responsibility goes to the Lord. Therefore, whenever there is general disregard
of regulative principles, the Lord Himself descends and corrects the society. We
should, however, note carefully that although we have to follow in the footsteps
of the Lord, we still have to remember that we cannot imitate Him. Following and
imitating are not on the same level. We cannot imitate the Lord by lifting
Govardhana Hill, as the Lord did in His childhood. It is impossible for any
human being. We have to follow His instructions, but we may not imitate Him at
any time. The Çrémad-Bhägavatam affirms:

naitat samäcarej jätu manasäpi hy anéçvaraù
vinaçyaty äcaran mauòhyäd yathä ’rudro ’bdhijaà viñam

éçvaräëäà vacaù satyaà tathaiväcaritaà kvacit
teñäà yat sva-vaco yuktaà buddhimäàs tat samäcaret

“One should simply follow the instructions of the Lord and His empowered
servants. Their instructions are all good for us, and any intelligent person
will perform them as instructed. However, one should guard against trying to
imitate their actions. One should not try to drink the ocean of poison in
imitation of Lord Çiva.” (Bhäg. 10.33.30)

We should always consider the position of the éçvaras, or those who can actually
control the movements of the sun and moon, as superior. Without such power, one
cannot imitate the éçvaras, who are superpowerful. Lord Çiva drank poison to the
extent of swallowing an ocean, but if any common man tries to drink even a
fragment of such poison, he will be killed. There are many psuedo-devotees of
Lord Çiva who want to indulge in smoking gäïjä (marijuana) and similar
intoxicating drugs, forgetting that by so imitating the acts of Lord Çiva they
are calling death very near. Similarly, there are some psuedo-devotees of Lord
Kåñëa who prefer to imitate the Lord in His räsa-lélä, or dance of love,
forgetting their inability to lift Govardhana Hill. It is best, therefore, that
one not try to imitate the powerful, but simply follow their instructions; nor
should one try to occupy their posts without qualification. There are so many
“incarnations” of God without the power of the Supreme Godhead.

TRANSLATION
As the ignorant perform their duties with attachment to results, similarly the
learned may also act, but without attachment, for the sake of leading people on
the right path.

PURPORT
A person in Kåñëa consciousness and a person not in Kåñëa consciousness are
differentiated by different desires. A Kåñëa conscious person does not do
anything which is not conducive to development of Kåñëa consciousness. He may
even act exactly like the ignorant person, who is too much attached to material
activities, but one is engaged in such activities for the satisfaction of his
sense gratification, whereas the other is engaged for the satisfaction of Kåñëa.
Therefore, the Kåñëa conscious person is required to show the people how to act
and how to engage the results of action for the purpose of Kåñëa consciousness.

Let not the wise disrupt the minds of the ignorant who are attached to fruitive

PURPORT
Vedaiç ca sarvair aham eva vedyaù: that is the end of all Vedic rituals. All
rituals, all performances of sacrifices, and everything that is put into the
Vedas, including all directions for material activities, are meant for
understanding Kåñëa, who is the ultimate goal of life. But because the
conditioned souls do not know anything beyond sense gratification, they study
the Vedas to that end. Through sense regulations, however, one is gradually
elevated to Kåñëa consciousness. Therefore a realized soul in Kåñëa
consciousness should not disturb others in their activities or understanding,
but he should act by showing how the results of all work can be dedicated to the
service of Kåñëa. The learned Kåñëa conscious person may act in such a way that
the ignorant person working for sense gratification may learn how to act and how
to behave. Although the ignorant man is not to be disturbed in his activities,
still, a slightly developed Kåñëa conscious person may directly be engaged in
the service of the Lord without waiting for other Vedic formulas. For this
fortunate man there is no need to follow the Vedic rituals, because in direct
Kåñëa consciousness one can have all the results simply by following the
prescribed duties of a particular person.

TRANSLATION
The bewildered spirit soul, under the influence of the three modes of material
nature, thinks himself to be the doer of activities, which are in actuality
carried out by nature.

PURPORT
Two persons, one in Kåñëa consciousness and the other in material consciousness,
working on the same level, may appear to be working on the same platform, but
there is a wide gulf of difference in their respective positions. The person in
material consciousness is convinced by false ego that he is the doer of
everything. He does not know that the mechanism of the body is produced by
material nature, which works under the supervision of the Supreme Lord. The
materialistic person has no knowledge that ultimately he is under the control of
Kåñëa. The person in false ego takes all credit for doing everything
independantly, and that is the symptom of his nescience. He does not know that
this gross and subtle body is the creation of material nature, under the order
of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and as such his bodily and mental
activities should be engaged in the service of Kåñëa, in Kåñëa consciousness.
The ignorant man forgets that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is known as
Håñékeça, or the master of the senses of the material body, for due to his long
misuse of the senses in sense gratification, he is factually bewildered by the
false ego, which makes him forget his eternal relationship with Kåñëa.

TRANSLATION
One who is in knowledge of the Absolute Truth, O mighty-armed, does not engage
himself in the senses and sense gratification, knowing well the differences
between work in devotion and work for fruitive results.

PURPORT
The knower of the Absolute Truth is convinced of his awkward position in
material association. He knows that he is part and parcel of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, and that his position should not be in the
material creation. He knows his real identity as part and parcel of the Supreme,
who is eternal bliss and knowledge, and he realizes that somehow or other he is
entrapped in the material conception of life. In his pure state of existence he
is meant to dovetail his activities in devotional service to the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa. He therefore engages himself in the activities of
Kåñëa consciousness and becomes naturally unattached to the activities of the
material senses, which are all circumstantial and temporary. He knows that his
material condition of life is under the supreme control of the Lord;
consequently he is not disturbed by all kinds of material reactions, which he
considers to be the mercy of the Lord. According to Çrémad-Bhägavatam, one who
knows the Absolute Truth in three different features—namely Brahman, Paramätmä,
and the Supreme Personality of Godhead—is called tattvavit, for he knows also
his own factual position in relationship with the Supreme.

TRANSLATION
Bewildered by the modes of material nature, the ignorant fully engage themselves
in material activities and become attached. But the wise should not unsettle
them, although these duties are inferior due to the performers’ lack of
knowledge.

PURPORT
Persons who are unknowledgeable falsely identify with gross material
consciousness and are full of material designations. This body is a gift of the
material nature, and one who is too much attached to the bodily consciousness is
called mandän, or a lazy person without understanding of spirit soul. Ignorant
men think of the body as the self; bodily connections with others are accepted
as kinsmanship; the land in which the body is obtained is the object of worship;
and the formalities of religious rituals are considered ends in themselves.
Social work, nationalism, and altruism are some of the activities for such
materially designated persons. Under the spell of such designations, they are
always busy in the material field; for them spiritual realization is a myth, and
so they are not interested. Such bewildered persons may even be engaged in such
primary moral principles of life as nonviolence and similar materially
benevolent work. Those who are, however, enlightened in spiritual life, should
not try to agitate such materially engrossed persons. Better to prosecute one’s
own spiritual activities silently.

Men who are ignorant cannot appreciate activities in Kåñëa consciousness, and
therefore Lord Kåñëa advises us not to disturb them and simply waste valuable
time. But the devotees of the Lord are more kind than the Lord because they
understand the purpose of the Lord. Consequently they undertake all kinds of
risks, even to the point of approaching ignorant men to try to engage them in
the acts of Kåñëa consciousness, which are absolutely necessary for the human
being.

TRANSLATION
Therefore, O Arjuna, surrendering all your works unto Me, with mind intent on
Me, and without desire for gain and free from egoism and lethargy, fight.

PURPORT
This verse clearly indicates the purpose of the Bhagavad-gétä. The Lord
instructs that one has to become fully Kåñëa conscious to discharge duties, as
if in military discipline. Such an injunction may make things a little
difficult; nevertheless duties must be carried out, with dependence on Kåñëa,
because that is the constitutional position of the living entity. The living
entity cannot be happy independant of the cooperation of the Supreme Lord
because the eternal constitutional position of the living entity is to become
subordinate to the desires of the Lord. Arjuna was, therefore, ordered by Çré
Kåñëa to fight as if the Lord were his military commander. One has to sacrifice
everything for the good will of the Supreme Lord, and at the same time discharge
prescribed duties without claiming proprietorship. Arjuna did not have to
consider the order of the Lord; he had only to execute His order. The Supreme
Lord is the Soul of all souls; therefore, one who depends solely and wholly on
the Supreme Soul without personal consideration, or in other words, one who is
fully Kåñëa conscious, is called adhyätma-cetasä. Niräçéù means that one has to
act on the order of the master. Nor should one ever expect fruitive results. The
cashier may count millions of dollars for his employer, but he does not claim a
cent for himself. Similarly, one has to realize that nothing in the world
belongs to any individual person, but that everything belongs to the Supreme
Lord. That is the real purport of mayi, or unto Me. And when one acts in such
Kåñëa consciousness, certainly he does not claim proprietorship over anything.
This consciousness is called nirmama, or nothing is mine. And, if there is any
reluctance to execute such a stern order which is without consideration of
so-called kinsmen in the bodily relationship, that reluctance should be thrown
off; in this way one may become vigata-jvara, or without feverish mentality or
lethargy. Everyone, according to his quality and position, has a particular type
of work to discharge, and all such duties may be discharged in Kåñëa
consciousness, as described above. That will lead one to the path of liberation.

TRANSLATION
One who executes his duties according to My injunctions and who follows this
teaching faithfully, without envy, becomes free from the bondage of fruitive
actions.

PURPORT
The injunction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, is the essence of
all Vedic wisdom, and therefore is eternally true without exception. As the
Vedas are eternal, so this truth of Kåñëa consciousness is also eternal. One
should have firm faith in this injunction, without envying the Lord. There are
many philosophers who write comments on the Bhagavad-gétä but have no faith in
Kåñëa. They will never be liberated from the bondage of fruitive action. But an
ordinary man with firm faith in the eternal injunctions of the Lord, even though
unable to execute such orders, becomes liberated from the bondage of the law of
karma. In the beginning of Kåñëa consciousness, one may not fully discharge the
injunctions of the Lord, but because one is not resentful of this principle and
works sincerely without consideration of defeat and hopelessness, he will surely
be promoted to the stage of pure Kåñëa consciousness.

But those who, out of envy, disregard these teachings and do not practice them
regularly, are to be considered bereft of all knowledge, befooled, and doomed to
ignorance and bondage.

PURPORT
The flaw of not being Kåñëa conscious is clearly stated herein. As there is
punishment for disobedience to the order of the supreme executive head, so there
is certainly punishment for the disobedience of the order of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. A disobedient person, however great he may be, is
ignorant of his own self, of the Supreme Brahman, and Paramätmä and the
Personality of Godhead, due to a vacant heart. Therefore there is no hope of
perfection of life for him.

Even a man of knowledge acts according to his own nature, for everyone follows

PURPORT
Unless one is situated on the transcendental platform of Kåñëa consciousness, he
cannot get free from the influence of the modes of material nature, as it is
confirmed by the Lord in the Seventh Chapter (7.14). Therefore, even for the
most highly educated person on the mundane plane, it is impossible to get out of
the entanglement of mäyä simply by theoretical knowledge, or by separating the
soul from the body. There are many so-called spiritualists who outwardly pose to
be advanced in the science, but inwardly or privately are completely under the
particular modes of nature which they are unable to surpass. Academically, one
may be very learned, but because of his long association with material nature,
he is in bondage. Kåñëa consciousness helps one to get out of the material
entanglement, even though one may be engaged in his prescribed duties.
Therefore, without being fully in Kåñëa consciousness, no one should suddenly
give up his prescribed duties and become a so-called yogé or transcendentalist
artificially. It is better to be situated in one’s position and to try to attain
Kåñëa consciousness under superior training. Thus one may be freed from the
clutches of mäyä.

TRANSLATION
Attraction and repulsion for sense objects are felt by embodied beings, but one
should not fall under the control of senses and sense objects because they are
stumbling blocks on the path of self-realization.

PURPORT
Those who are in Kåñëa consciousness are naturally reluctant to engage in
material sense gratifications. But those who are not in such consciousness
should follow the rules and regulations of the revealed scriptures. Unrestricted
sense enjoyment is the cause of material encagement, but one who follows the
rules and regulations of the revealed scriptures does not become entangled by
the sense objects. For example, sex enjoyment is a necessity for the conditioned
soul, and sex enjoyment is allowed under the license of marriage ties. For
example, according to scriptural injunctions, one is forbidden to engage in sex
relationships with any women other than one’s wife. All other women are to be
considered as one’s mother. But, in spite of such injunctions, a man is still
inclined to have sex relationships with other women. These propensities are to
be curbed; otherwise they will be stumbling blocks on the path of
self-realization. As long as the material body is there, the necessities of the
material body are allowed, but under rules and regulations. And yet, we should
not rely upon the control of such allowances. One has to follow those rules and
regulations, unattached to them, because practice of sense gratifications under
regulations may also lead one to go astray—as much as there is always the chance
of an accident, even on the royal roads. Although they may be very carefully
maintained, no one can guarantee that there will be no danger even on the safest
road. The sense enjoyment spirit has been current a very long, long time, owing
to material association. Therefore, in spite of regulated sense enjoyment, there
is every chance of falling down; therefore any attachment for regulated sense
enjoyment must also be avoided by all means. But action in the loving service of
Kåñëa detaches one from all kinds of sensory activities. Therefore, no one
should try to be detached from Kåñëa consciousness at any stage of life. The
whole purpose of detachment from all kinds of sense attachment is ultimately to
become situated on the platform of Kåñëa consciousness.

TRANSLATION
It is far better to discharge one’s prescribed duties, even though they may be
faulty, than another’s duties. Destruction in the course of performing one’s own
duty is better than engaging in another’s duties, for to follow another’s path
is dangerous.

PURPORT
One should therefore discharge his prescribed duties in full Kåñëa consciousness
rather than those prescribed for others. Prescribed duties complement one’s
psychophysical condition, under the spell of the modes of material nature.
Spiritual duties are as ordered by the spiritual master, for the transcendental
service of Kåñëa. But both materially or spiritually, one should stick to his
prescribed duties even up to death, rather than imitate another’s prescribed
duties. Duties on the spiritual platform and duties on the material platform may
be different, but the principle of following the authorized direction is always
good for the performer. When one is under the spell of the modes of material
nature, one should follow the prescribed rules for particular situations and
should not imitate others. For example, a brähmaëa, who is in the mode of
goodness, is nonviolent, whereas a kñatriya, who is in the mode of passion, is
allowed to be violent. As such, for a kñatriya it is better to be vanquished
following the rules of violence than to imitate a brähmaëa who follows the
principles of nonviolence. Everyone has to cleanse his heart by a gradual
process, not abruptly. However, when one transcends the modes of material nature
and is fully situated in Kåñëa consciousness, he can perform anything and
everything under the direction of the bona fide spiritual master. In that
complete stage of Kåñëa consciousness, the kñatriya may act as a brähmaëa, or a
brähmaëa may act as a kñatriya. In the transcendental stage, the distinctions of
the material world do not apply. For example, Viçvämitra was originally a
kñatriya, but later on he acted as a brähmaëa, whereas Paraçuräma was a
brähmaëa, but later on he acted as a kñatriya. Being transcendentally situated,
they could do so; but as long as one is on the material platform, he must
perform his duties according to the modes of material nature. At the same time,
he must have a full sense of Kåñëa consciousness.

Arjuna said: O descendant of Våñëi, by what is one impelled to sinful acts, even

PURPORT
A living entity, as part and parcel of the Supreme, is originally spiritual,
pure, and free from all material contaminations. Therefore, by nature he is not
subjected to the sins of the material world. But when he is in contact with the
material nature, he acts in many sinful ways without hesitation, and sometimes
even against his will. As such, Arjuna’s question to Kåñëa is very sanguine, as
to the perverted nature of the living entities. Although the living entity
sometimes does not want to act in sin, he is still forced to act. Sinful actions
are not, however, impelled by the Supersoul within, but are due to another
cause, as the Lord explains in the next verse.

TRANSLATION
The Blessed Lord said: It is lust only, Arjuna, which is born of contact with
the material modes of passion and later transformed into wrath, and which is the
all-devouring, sinful enemy of this world.

PURPORT
When a living entity comes in contact with the material creation, his eternal
love for Kåñëa is transformed into lust, in association with the mode of
passion. Or, in other words, the sense of love of God becomes transformed into
lust, as milk in contact with sour tamarind is transformed into yogurt. Then
again, when lust is unsatisfied, it turns into wrath; wrath is transformed into
illusion, and illusion continues the material existence. Therefore, lust is the
greatest enemy of the living entity, and it is lust only which induces the pure
living entity to remain entangled in the material world. Wrath is the
manifestation of the mode of ignorance; these modes exhibit themselves as wrath
and other corollaries. If, therefore, the modes of passion, instead of being
degraded into the modes of ignorance, are elevated to the modes of goodness by
the prescribed method of Iiving and acting, then one can be saved from the
degradation of wrath by spiritual attachment.

The Supreme Personality of Godhead expanded Himself into many for His
ever-increasing spiritual bliss, and the living entities are parts and parcels
of this spiritual bliss. They also have partial independence, but by misuse of
their independence, when the service attitude is transformed into the propensity
for sense enjoyment, they come under the sway of lust. This material creation is
created by the Lord to give a facility to the conditioned souls to fulfill these
lustful propensities, and when they are completely baffled by prolonged lustful
activities, the living entities begin to inquire about their real position.

This inquiry is the beginning of the Vedänta-sütras, wherein it is said, athäto
brahma-jijïäsä: one should inquire into the Supreme. And the Supreme is defined
in Çrémad-Bhägavatam as janmädyasya yato ’nvayäd itarataç ca, or, "The origin of
everything is the Supreme Brahman." Therefore, the origin of lust is also in the
Supreme. If, therefore, lust is transformed into love for the Supreme, or
transformed into Kåñëa consciousness—or, in other words, desiring everything for
Kåñëa—then both lust and wrath can be spiritualized. Hanumän, the great servitor
of Lord Rama, engaged his wrath upon his enemies for the satisfaction of the
Lord. Therefore, lust and wrath, when they are employed in Kåñëa consciousness,
become our friends instead of our enemies.

TRANSLATION
As fire is covered by smoke, as a mirror is covered by dust, or as the embryo is
covered by the womb, similarly, the living entity is covered by different
degrees of this lust.

PURPORT
There are three degrees of covering of the living entity by which his pure
consciousness is obscured. This covering is but lust under different
manifestations like smoke in the fire, dust on the mirror, and the womb about
the embryo. When lust is compared to smoke, it is understood that the fire of
the living spark can be a little perceived. In other words, when the living
entity exhibits his Kåñëa consciousness slightly, he may be likened to the fire
covered by smoke. Although fire is necessary where there is smoke, there is no
overt manifestation of fire in the early stage. This stage is like the beginning
of Kåñëa consciousness. The dust on the mirror refers to a cleansing process of
the mirror of the mind by so many spiritual methods. The best process is to
chant the holy names of the Lord. The embryo covered by the womb is an analogy
illustrating a helpless position, for the child in the womb is so helpless that
he cannot even move. This stage of living condition can be compared to that of
the trees. The trees are also living entities, but they have been put in such a
condition of life by such a great exhibition of lust that they are almost void
of all consciousness. The covered mirror is compared to the birds and beasts,
and the smoke covered fire is compared to the human being. In the form of a
human being, the living entity may revive a little Kåñëa consciousness, and, if
he makes further development, the fire of spiritual life can be kindled in the
human form of life. By careful handling of the smoke in the fire, the fire can
be made to blaze. Therefore the human form of life is a chance for the living
entity to escape the entanglement of material existence. In the human form of
life, one can conquer the enemy, lust, by cultivation of Kåñëa consciousness
under able guidance.

son of Kunté; duñpüreëa—never to be satisfied; analena—by the fire; ca—also.

TRANSLATION
Thus, a man’s pure consciousness is covered by his eternal enemy in the form of
lust, which is never satisfied and which burns like fire.

PURPORT
It is said in the Manu-småti that lust cannot be satisfied by any amount of
sense enjoyment, just as fire is never extinguished by a constant supply of
fuel. In the material world, the center of all activities is sex, and thus this
material world is called maithuëya-ägära, or the shackles of sex life. In the
ordinary prison house, criminals are kept within bars; similarly, the criminals
who are disobedient to the laws of the Lord are shackled by sex life.
Advancement of material civilization on the basis of sense gratification means
increasing the duration of the material existence of a living entity. Therefore,
this lust is the symbol of ignorance by which the living entity is kept within
the material world. While one enjoys sense gratification, it may be that there
is some feeling of happiness, but actually that so-called feeling of happiness
is the ultimate enemy of the sense enjoyer.

TRANSLATION
The senses, the mind and the intelligence are the sitting places of this lust,
which veils the real knowledge of the living entity and bewilders him.

PURPORT
The enemy has captured different strategic positions in the body of the
conditioned soul, and therefore Lord Kåñëa is giving hints of those places, so
that one who wants to conquer the enemy may know where he can be found. Mind is
the center of all the activities of the senses, and thus the mind is the
reservoir of all ideas of sense gratification; and, as a result, the mind and
the senses become the repositories of lust. Next, the intelligence department
becomes the capital of such lustful propensities. Intelligence is the immediate
next-door neighbor of the spirit soul. Lusty intelligence influences the spirit
soul to acquire the false ego and identify itself with matter, and thus with the
mind and senses. The spirit soul becomes addicted to enjoying the material
senses and mistakes this as true happiness. This false identification of the
spirit soul is very nicely explained in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam:

yasyätma-buddhiù kuëäpe tri-dhätuke
sva-dhéù kalaträdiñu bhauma idyadhéù
yat-tértha-buddhiù salite na karhicij
janeñv abhijïeñu sa eva gokharaù.

"A human being who identifies this body made of three elements with his self,
who considers the by-products of the body to be his kinsmen, who considers the
land of birth as worshipable, and who goes to the place of pilgrimage simply to
take a bath rather than meet men of transcendental knowledge there, is to be
considered as an ass or a cow."

TRANSLATION
Therefore, O Arjuna, best of the Bhäratas, in the very beginning curb this great
symbol of sin [lust] by regulating the senses, and slay this destroyer of
knowledge and self-realization.

PURPORT
The Lord advised Arjuna to regulate the senses from the very beginning so that
he could curb the greatest sinful enemy, lust, which destroys the urge for
self-realization, and specifically, knowledge of the self. Jïänam refers to
knowledge of self as distinguished from non-self, or, in other words, knowledge
that the spirit soul is not the body. Vijïänam refers to specific knowledge of
the spirit soul and knowledge of one’s constitutional position and his
relationship to the Supreme Soul. It is explained thus in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam:
jïänaà parama-guhyaà me yad-vijïäna-samanvitam / sarahasyaà tad-aìgaà ca gåhäna
gaditaà mayä: "The knowledge of the self and the Supreme Self is very
confidential and mysterious, being veiled by mäyä, but such knowledge and
specific realization can be understood if it is explained by the Lord Himself."
Bhagavad-gétä gives us that knowledge, specifically knowledge of the self. The
living entities are parts and parcels of the Lord, and therefore they are simply
meant to serve the Lord. This consciousness is called Kåñëa consciousness. So,
from the very beginning of life one has to learn this Kåñëa consciousness, and
thereby one may become fully Kåñëa conscious and act accordingly.

Lust is only the perverted reflection of the love of God which is natural for
every living entity. But if one is educated in Kåñëa consciousness from the very
beginning, that natural love of God cannot deteriorate into lust. When love of
God deteriorates into lust, it is very difficult to return to the normal
condition. Nonetheless, Kåñëa consciousness is so powerful that even a late
beginner can become a lover of God by following the regulative principles of
devotional service. So, from any stage of life, or from the time of
understanding its urgency, one can begin regulating the senses in Kåñëa
consciousness, devotional service of the Lord, and turn the lust into love of
Godhead—the highest perfectional stage of human life.

TRANSLATION
The working senses are superior to dull matter; mind is higher than the senses;
intelligence is still higher than the mind; and he [the soul] is even higher
than the intelligence.

PURPORT
The senses are different outlets for the activities of lust. Lust is reserved
within the body, but it is given vent through the senses. Therefore, the senses
are superior to the body as a whole. These outlets are not in use when there is
superior consciousness, or Kåñëa consciousness. In Kåñëa consciousness the soul
makes direct connection with the Supreme Personality of Godhead; therefore the
bodily functions, as described here, ultimately end in the Supreme Soul. Bodily
action means the functions of the senses, and stopping the senses means stopping
all bodily actions. But since the mind is active, then, even though the body may
be silent and at rest, the mind will act—as it does during dreaming. But, above
the mind there is the determination of the intelligence, and above the
intelligence is the soul proper. If, therefore, the soul is directly engaged
with the Supreme, naturally all other subordinates, namely, the intelligence,
mind and the senses, will be automatically engaged. In the Kaöha Upaniñad there
is a passage in which it is said that the objects of sense gratification are
superior to the senses, and mind is superior to the sense objects. If,
therefore, the mind is directly engaged in the service of the Lord constantly,
then there is no chance of the senses becoming engaged in other ways. This
mental attitude has already been explained. If the mind is engaged in the
transcendental service of the Lord, there is no chance of its being engaged in
the lower propensities. In the Kaöha Upaniñad the soul has been described as
mahän, the great. Therefore the soul is above all—namely, the sense objects, the
senses, the mind and the intelligence. Therefore, directly understanding the
constitutional position of the soul is the solution of the whole problem.

With intelligence one has to seek out the constitutional position of the soul
and then engage the mind always in Kåñëa consciousness. That solves the whole
problem. A neophyte spiritualist is generally advised to keep aloof from the
objects of senses. One has to strengthen the mind by use of intelligence. If by
intelligence one engages one’s mind in Kåñëa consciousness, by complete
surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, then, automatically, the mind
becomes stronger, and even though the senses are very strong, like serpents,
they will be no more effective than serpents with broken fangs. But even though
the soul is the master of intelligence and mind, and the senses also, still,
unless it is strengthened by association with Kåñëa in Kåñëa consciousness,
there is every chance of falling down due to the agitated mind.

TRANSLATION
Thus knowing oneself to be transcendental to material senses, mind and

spiritual strength—conquer this insatiable enemy known as lust.

PURPORT
This Third Chapter of the Bhagavad-gétä is conclusively directive to Kåñëa
consciousness by knowing oneself as the eternal servitor of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, without considering impersonal voidness as the ultimate
end. In the material existence of life, one is certainly influenced by
propensities for lust and desire for dominating the resources of material
nature. Desire for overlording and sense gratification are the greatest enemies
of the conditioned soul; but by the strength of Kåñëa consciousness, one can
control the material senses, the mind and the intelligence. One may not give up
work and prescribed duties all of a sudden; but by gradually developing Kåñëa
consciousness, one can be situated in a transcendental position without being
influenced by the material senses and the mind—by steady intelligence directed
toward one’s pure identity. This is the sum total of this chapter. In the
immature stage of material existence, philosophical speculations and artificial
attempts to control the senses by the so-called practice of yogic postures can
never help a man toward spiritual life. He must be trained in Kåñëa
consciousness by higher intelligence.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Third Chapter of the
Çrémad-Bhagavad-gétä in the matter of Karma-yoga, or the Discharge of One’s
Prescribed Duty in Kåñëa Consciousness.

TRANSLATION
The Blessed Lord said: I instructed this imperishable science of yoga to the
sun-god, Vivasvän, and Vivasvän instructed it to Manu, the father of mankind,
and Manu in turn instructed it to Ikñväku.

PURPORT
Herein we find the history of the Bhagavad-gétä traced from a remote time when
it was delivered to the royal order, the kings of all planets. This science is
especially meant for the protection of the inhabitants and therefore the royal
order should understand it in order to be able to rule the citizens and protect
them from the material bondage to lust. Human life is meant for cultivation of
spiritual knowledge, in eternal relationship with the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, and the executive heads of all states and all planets are obliged to
impart this lesson to the citizens by education, culture and devotion. In other
words, the executive heads of all states are intended to spread the science of
Kåñëa consciousness so that the people may take advantage of this great science
and pursue a successful path, utilizing the opportunity of the human form of
life.

In this millennium, the sun-god is known as Vivasvän, the king of the sun, which
is the origin of all planets within the solar system. In the Brahma-saàhitä [Bs.
5.52] it is stated:

yac-cakñur eña savitä sakala-grahäëäà
räjä samasta-sura-mürttir açeña-tejäù
yasyäjïayä bhramati sambhåta-kälacakro
govindam ädi-puruñaà tam ahaà bhajämi

"Let me worship," Lord Brahmä said, "the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda
[Kåñëa], who is the original person and under whose order the sun, which is the
king of all planets, is assuming immense power and heat. The sun represents the
eye of the Lord and traverses its orbit in obedience to His order."

The sun is the king of the planets, and the sun-god (at present of the name
Vivasvän) rules the sun planet, which is controlling all other planets by
supplying heat and light. He is rotating under the order of Kåñëa, and Lord
Kåñëa originally made Vivasvän His first disciple to understand the science of
Bhagavad-gétä. The Gétä is not, therefore, a speculative treatise for the
insignificant mundane scholar but is a standard book of knowledge coming down
from time immemorial. In the Mahäbhärata (Çänti-parva 348.51–52) we can trace
out the history of the Gétä as follows:

tretä-yugädau ca tato vivasvän manave dadau
manuç ca loka-bhåty-arthaà sutäyekñväkave dadau
ikñväkuëä ca kathito vyäpya lokän avasthitäù

"In the beginning of the Tretä-yuga [millennium] this science of the
relationship with the Supreme was delivered by Vivasvän to Manu. Manu, being the
father of mankind, gave it to his son Mahäräja Ikñväku, the King of this earth
planet and forefather of the Raghu dynasty in which Lord Rämacandra appeared.
Therefore, Bhagavad-gétä existed in the human society from the time of Mahäräja
Ikñväku."

At the present moment we have just passed through five thousand years of the
Kali-yuga, which lasts 432,000 years. Before this there was Dväpara-yuga
(800,000 years), and before that there was Tretä-yuga (1,200,000 years). Thus,
some 2,005,000 years ago, Manu spoke the Bhagavad-gétä to his disciple and son
Mahäräja lkñväku, the King of this planet earth. The age of the current Manu is
calculated to last some 305,300,000 years, of which 120,400,000 have passed.
Accepting that before the birth of Manu, the Gétä was spoken by the Lord to His
disciple, the sun-god Vivasvän, a rough estimate is that the Gétä was spoken at
least 120,400,000 years ago; and in human society it has been extant for two
million years. It was respoken by the Lord again to Arjuna about five thousand
years ago. That is the rough estimate of the history of the Géta, according to
the Gétä itself and according to the version of the speaker, Lord Çré Kåñëa. It
was spoken to the sun-god Vivasvän because he is also a kñatriya and is the
father of all kñatriyas who are descendants of the sun-god, or the sürya-vaàça
kñatriyas. Because Bhagavad-gétä is as good as the Vedas, being spoken by the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, this knowledge is apauruñeya, superhuman. Since
the Vedic instructions are accepted as they are, without human interpretation,
the Gétä must therefore be accepted without mundane interpretation. The mundane
wranglers may speculate on the Gétä in their own ways, but that is not
Bhagavad-gétä as it is. Therefore, Bhagavad-gétä has to be accepted as it is,
from the disciplic succession, and it is described herein that the Lord spoke to
the sun-god, the sun-god spoke to his son Manu, and Manu spoke to his son
Ikñväku.

TRANSLATION
This supreme science was thus received through the chain of disciplic
succession, and the saintly kings understood it in that way. But in course of
time the succession was broken, and therefore the science as it is appears to be
lost.

PURPORT
It is clearly stated that the Gétä was especially meant for the saintly kings
because they were to execute its purpose in ruling over the citizens. Certainly
Bhagavad-gétä was never meant for the demonic persons, who would dissipate its
value for no one’s benefit and would devise all types of interpretations
according to personal whims. As soon as the original purpose was scattered by
the motives of the unscrupulous commentators, there arose the need to
reestablish the disciplic succession. Five thousand years ago it was detected by
the Lord Himself that the disciplic succession was broken, and therefore He
declared that the purpose of the Gétä appeared to be lost. In the same way, at
the present moment also there are so many editions of the Gétä (especially in
English), but almost all of them are not according to authorized disciplic
succession. There are innumerable interpretations rendered by different mundane
scholars, but almost all of them do not accept the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, Kåñëa, although they make a good business on the words of Çré Kåñëa.
This spirit is demonic, because demons do not believe in God but simply enjoy
the property of the Supreme. Since there is a great need of an edition of the
Gétä in English, as it is received by the paramparä (disciplic succession)
system, an attempt is made herewith to fulfill this great want.
Bhagavad-gétä—accepted as it is—is a great boon to humanity; but if it is
accepted as a treatise of philosophical speculations, it is simply a waste of
time.

TRANSLATION
That very ancient science of the relationship with the Supreme is today told by
Me to you because you are My devotee as well as My friend; therefore you can
understand the transcendental mystery of this science.

PURPORT
There are two classes of men, namely the devotee and the demon. The Lord
selected Arjuna as the recipient of this great science owing to his becoming the
devotee of the Lord, but for the demon it is not possible to understand this
great mysterious science. There are a number of editions of this great book of
knowledge, and some of them have commentaries by the devotees, and some of them
have commentaries by the demons. Commentation by the devotees is real, whereas
that of the demons is useless. Arjuna accepts Çré Kåñëa as the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, and any commentary on the Gétä following in the
footsteps of Arjuna is real devotional service to the cause of this great
science. The demonic, however, concoct something about Kåñëa and mislead the
public and general readers from the path of Kåñëa’s instructions. One should try
to follow the disciplic succession from Arjuna, and thus be benefitted.

TRANSLATION
Arjuna said: The sun-god Vivasvän is senior by birth to You. How am I to
understand that in the beginning You instructed this science to him?

PURPORT
Arjuna is an accepted devotee of the Lord, so how could he not believe Kåñëa’s
words? The fact is that Arjuna is not inquiring for himself but for those who do
not believe in the Supreme Personality of Godhead or for the demons who do not
like the idea that Kåñëa should be accepted as the Supreme Personality of
Godhead; for them only Arjuna inquires on this point, as if he were himself not
aware of the Personality of Godhead, or Kåñëa. As it will be evident from the
Tenth Chapter, Arjuna knew perfectly well that Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, the fountainhead of everything and the last word in Transcendence.
Of course, Kåñëa also appeared as the son of Devaké on this earth. How Kåñëa
remained the same Supreme Personality of Godhead, the eternal, original person,
is very difficult for an ordinary man to understand. Therefore, to clarify this
point, Arjuna put this question before Kåñëa so that He Himself could speak
authoritatively. That Kåñëa is the supreme authority is accepted by the whole
world, not only at present, but from time immemorial, and the demons alone
reject Him. Anyway, since Kåñëa is the authority accepted by all, Arjuna put
this question before Him in order that Kåñëa would describe Himself without
being depicted by the demons who always try to distort Him in a way
understandable to the demons and their followers. It is necessary that everyone,
for his own interest, know the science of Kåñëa. Therefore, when Kåñëa Himself
speaks about Himself, it is auspicious for all the worlds. To the demons, such
explanations by Kåñëa Himself may appear to be strange because the demons always
study Kåñëa from their own standpoint, but those who are devotees heartily
welcome the statements of Kåñëa when they are spoken by Kåñëa Himself. The
devotees will always worship such authoritative statements of Kåñëa because they
are always eager to know more and more about Him. The atheists, who consider
Kåñëa an ordinary man, may in this way come to know that Kåñëa is superhuman,
that He is sac-cid-änanda-vigraha—the eternal form of bliss and knowledge—that
He is transcendental, and that He is above the domination of the modes of
material nature and above the influence of time and space. A devotee of Kåñëa’s,
like Arjuna, is undoubtedly above any misunderstanding of the transcendental
position of Kåñëa. Arjuna’s putting this question before the Lord is simply an
attempt by the devotee to defy the atheistic attitude of persons who consider
Kåñëa to be an ordinary human being subject to the modes of material nature.

(Bs. 5.33)

"I worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda [Kåñëa], who is the
original person—absolute, infallible, without beginning, although expanded into
unlimited forms, still the same original, the oldest, and the person always
appearing as a fresh youth. Such eternal, blissful, all-knowing forms of the
Lord are usually understood by the best Vedic scholars, but they are always
manifest to pure, unalloyed devotees." It is also stated in Brahma-saàhitä:

rämädi mürttiñu kalä-niyamena tiñöhan
nänävatäram akarod bhuvaneñu kintu
kåñëaù svayaà samabhavat paramaù pumän yo
govindam ädi-puruñaà tam ahaà bhajämi
(Bs. 5.39)

"I worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda [Kåñëa], who is always
situated in various incarnations such as Räma, Nåsiàha and many sub-incarnations
as well, but who is the original Personality of Godhead known as Kåñëa, and who
incarnates personally also."

In the Vedas also it is said that the Lord, although one without a second,
nevertheless manifests Himself in innumerable forms. He is like the vaidurya
stone, which changes color yet still remains one. All those multi-forms are
understood by the pure, unalloyed devotees, but not by a simple study of the
Vedas: vedeñu durllabham adurllabham ätma-bhaktau. Devotees like Arjuna are
constant companions of the Lord, and whenever the Lord incarnates, the associate
devotees also incarnate in order to serve the Lord in different capacities.
Arjuna is one of these devotees, and in this verse it is understood that some
millions of years ago when Lord Kåñëa spoke the Bhagavad-gétä to the sun-god
Vivasvän, Arjuna, in a different capacity, was also present. But the difference
between the Lord and Arjuna is that the Lord remembered the incidence, whereas
Arjuna could not remember. That is the difference between the part and parcel
living entity and the Supreme Lord. Although Arjuna is addressed herein as the
mighty hero who could subdue the enemies, he is unable to recall what had
happened in his various past births. Therefore, a living entity, however great
he may be in the material estimation, can never equal the Supreme Lord. Anyone
who is a constant companion of the Lord is certainly a liberated person, but he
cannot be equal to the Lord. The Lord is described in the Brahma-saàhitä as
infallible (acyuta), which means that He never forgets Himself, even though He
is in material contact. Therefore, the Lord and the living entity can never be
equal in all respects, even if the living entity is as liberated as Arjuna.
Although Arjuna is a devotee of the Lord, he sometimes forgets the nature of the
Lord, but by the divine grace a devotee can at once understand the infallible
condition of the Lord, whereas a nondevotee or a demon cannot understand this
transcendental nature. Consequently these descriptions in the Gétä cannot be
understood by demonic brains. Kåñëa remembered acts which were performed by Him
millions of years before, but Arjuna could not, despite the fact that both Kåñëa
and Arjuna are eternal in nature. We may also note herein that a living entity
forgets everything due to his change of body, but the Lord remembers because He
does not change His sac-cid-änanda body. He is advaita, which means there is no
distinction between His body and Himself. Everything in relation to Him is
spirit—whereas the conditioned soul is different from his material body. And,
because the Lord’s body and self are identical, His position is always different
from the ordinary living entity, even when He descends to the material platform.
The demons cannot adjust themselves to this transcendental nature of the Lord,
as the Lord explains in the following verse.

TRANSLATION
Although I am unborn and My transcendental body never deteriorates, and although
I am the Lord of all sentient beings, I still appear in every millennium in My
original transcendental form.

PURPORT
The Lord has spoken about the peculiarity of His birth: although He may appear
like an ordinary person, He remembers everything of His many, many past
"births," whereas a common man cannot remember what he has done even a few hours
before. If someone is asked what he did exactly at the same time one day
earlier, it would be very difficult for a common man to answer immediately. He
would surely have to dredge his memory to recall what he was doing exactly at
the same time one day before. And yet, men often dare claim to be God, or Kåñëa.
One should not be misled by such meaningless claims. Then again, the Lord
explains His prakåti or His form. Prakåti means nature as well as svarüpa, or
one’s own form. The Lord says that He appears in His own body. He does not
change His body, as the common living entity changes from one body to another.
The conditioned soul may have one kind of body in the present birth, but he has
a different body in the next birth. In the material world, the living entity has
no fixed body but transmigrates from one body to another. The Lord, however,
does not do so. Whenever He appears, He does so in the same original body, by
His internal potency. In other words, Kåñëa appears in this material world in
His original eternal form, with two hands, holding a flute. He appears exactly
in His eternal body, uncontaminated by this material world. Although He appears
in the same transcendental body and is Lord of the universe, it still appears
that He takes His birth like an ordinary living entity. Despite the fact Lord
Kåñëa grows from childhood to boyhood and from boyhood to youth, astonishingly
enough He never ages beyond youth. At the time of the Battle of Kurukñetra, He
had many grandchildren at home; or, in other words, He had sufficiently aged by
material calculations. Still He looked just like a young man twenty or
twenty-five years old. We never see a picture of Kåñëa in old age because He
never grows old like us, although He is the oldest person in the whole
creation—past, present, and future. Neither His body nor His intelligence ever
deteriorates or changes. Therefore, it is clear that in spite of His being in
the material world, He is the same unborn, eternal form of bliss and knowledge,
changeless in His transcendental body and intelligence. Factually, His
appearance and disappearance is like the sun’s rising, moving before us, and
then disappearing from our eyesight. When the sun is out of sight, we think that
the sun is set, and when the sun is before our eyes, we think that the sun is on
the horizon. Actually, the sun is always in its fixed position, but owing to our
defective, insufficient senses, we calculate the appearance and disappearance of
the sun in the sky. And, because His appearance and disappearance are completely
different from that of any ordinary, common living entity, it is evident that He
is eternal, blissful knowledge by His internal potency—and He is never
contaminated by material nature. The Vedas also confirm that the Supreme
Personality of Godhead is unborn, yet He still appears to take His birth in
multi-manifestations. The Vedic supplementary literatures also confirm that even
though the Lord appears to be taking His birth, He is still without change of
body. In the Bhägavatam, He appears before His mother as Näräyaëa, with four
hands and the decorations of the six kinds of full opulences. His appearance in
His original eternal form is His causeless mercy, according to the Viçvakoça
dictionary. The Lord is conscious of all of His previous appearances and
disappearances, but a common living entity forgets everything about his past
body as soon as he gets another body. He is the Lord of all living entities
because He performs wonderful and superhuman activities while He is on this
earth. Therefore, the Lord is always the same Absolute Truth and is without
differentiation between His form and self, or between His quality and body. A
question may now be raised as to why the Lord appears and disappears in this
world. This is explained in the next verse.

TRANSLATION
Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendant of

PURPORT
The word såjämi is significant herein. Såjämi cannot be used in the sense of
creation. because, according to the previous verse, there is no creation of the
Lord’s form or body, since all of the forms are eternally existent. Therefore
såjämi means that the Lord manifests Himself as He is. Although the Lord appears
on schedule, namely at the end of Dväpara-yuga of the twenty-eighth millennium
of the eighth Manu, in one day of Brahmä, still He has no obligation to adhere
to such rules and regulations because He is completely free to act in many ways
at His will. He therefore appears by His own will whenever there is a
predominance of irreligiosity and a disappearance of true religion. Principles
of religion are laid down in the Vedas, and any discrepancy in the matter of
properly executing the rules of the Vedas makes one irreligious. In the
Bhägavatam it is stated that such principles are the laws of the Lord. Only the
Lord can manufacture a system of religion. The Vedas are also accepted as
originally spoken by the Lord Himself to Brahmä, from within his heart.
Therefore, the principles of dharma, or religion, are the direct orders of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead (dharmaà tu säkñät-bhagavat-praëétam). These
principles are clearly indicated throughout the Bhagavad-gétä. The purpose of
the Vedas is to establish such principles under the order of the Supreme Lord,
and the Lord directly orders, at the end of the Gétä, that the highest principle
of religion is to surrender unto Him only, and nothing more. The Vedic
principles push one towards complete surrender unto Him; and, whenever such
principles are disturbed by the demonic, the Lord appears. From the Bhägavatam
we understand that Lord Buddha is the incarnation of Kåñëa who appeared when
materialism was rampant and materialists were using the pretext of the authority
of the Vedas. Although there are certain restrictive rules and regulations
regarding animal sacrifice for particular purposes in the Vedas, people of
demonic tendency still took to animal sacrifice without reference to the Vedic
principles. Lord Buddha appeared to stop this nonsense and to establish the
Vedic principles of nonviolence. Therefore each and every avatära, or
incarnation of the Lord, has a particular mission, and they are all described in
the revealed scriptures. No one should be accepted as an avatära unless he is
referred to by scriptures. It is not a fact that the Lord appears only on Indian
soil. He can advent Himself anywhere and everywhere, and whenever He desires to
appear. In each and every incarnation, He speaks as much about religion as can
be understood by the particular people under their particular circumstances. But
the mission is the same—to lead people to God consciousness and obedience to the
principles of religion. Sometimes He descends personally, and sometimes He sends
His bona fide representative in the form of His son, or servant, or Himself in
some disguised form.

The principles of the Bhagavad-gétä were spoken to Arjuna, and, for that matter,
to other highly elevated persons, because he was highly advanced compared to
ordinary persons in other parts of the world. Two plus two equals four is a
mathematical principle that is true both in the beginner’s arithmetic class and
in the advanced class as well. Still, there are higher and lower mathematics. In
all incarnations of the Lord, therefore, the same principles are taught, but
they appear to be higher and lower in varied circumstances. The higher
principles of religion begin with the acceptance of the four orders and the four
statuses of social life, as will be explained later. The whole purpose of the
mission of incarnations is to arouse Kåñëa consciousness everywhere. Such
consciousness is manifest and nonmanifest only under different circumstances.

PURPORT
According to Bhagavad-gétä, a sädhu (holyman) is a man in Kåñëa consciousness. A
person may appear to be irreligious, but if he has the qualifications of Kåñëa
consciousness wholly and fully, he is to be understood to be a sädhu. And
duñkåtam applies to one who doesn't care for Kåñëa consciousness. Such
miscreants, or duñkåtam, are described as foolish and the lowest of mankind,
even though they may be decorated with mundane education; whereas another
person, who is one hundred percent engaged in Kåñëa consciousness, is accepted
as sädhu, even though such a person may neither be learned nor well cultured. As
far as the atheistic are concerned, it is not necessary for the Supreme Lord to
appear as He is to destroy them, as He did with the demons Rävaëa and Kaàsa. The
Lord has many agents who are quite competent to vanquish demons. But the Lord
especially descends to appease His unalloyed devotees, who are always harassed
by the demonic. The demon harasses the devotee, even though the latter may
happen to be his kin. Although Prahläda Mahäräja was the son of Hiraëyakaçipu,
he was nonetheless persecuted by his father; although Devaké, the mother of
Kåñëa, was the sister of Kaàsa, she and her husband Vasudeva were persecuted
only because Kåñëa was to be born of them. So Lord Kåñëa appeared primarily to
deliver Devaké, rather than kill Kaàsa, but both were performed simultaneously.
Therefore it is said here that to deliver the devotee and vanquish the demon
miscreants, the Lord appears in different incarnations.

In the Caitanya-caritämåta of Kåñëadäsa Kaviräja, the following verses summarize
these principles of incarnation:

såñöi-hetu yei mürti prapaïce avatare
sei éçvara-mürti ‘avatära’ näma dhare
mäyätita paravyome savära avasthäna
viçve ‘avatäri’ dhare ‘avatära’ näma.

"The avatära, or incarnation of Godhead, descends from the kingdom of God for
material manifestation. And the particular form of the Personality of Godhead
who so descends is called an incarnation, or avatära. Such incarnations are
situated in the spiritual world, the kingdom of God. When they descend to the
material creation, they assume the name avatära."

There are various kinds of avatäras, such as puruñävatäras, guëävatäras,
lélävatäras, çaktyäveça avatäras, manvantara-avatäras and yugävatäras—all
appearing on schedule all over the universe. But Lord Kåñëa is the primeval
Lord, the fountainhead of all avatäras. Lord Çré Kåñëa descends for the specific
purposes of mitigating the anxieties of the pure devotees, who are very anxious
to see Him in His original Våndävana pastimes. Therefore, the prime purpose of
the Kåñëa avatära is to satisfy His unalloyed devotees.

The Lord says that He incarnates Himself in every millennium. This indicates
that He incarnates also in the age of Kali. As stated in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam,
the incarnation in the age of Kali is Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu, who spread the
worship of Kåñëa by the saìkértana movement (congregational chanting of the holy
names), and spread Kåñëa consciousness throughout India. He predicted that this
culture of saìkértana would be broadcast all over the world, from town to town
and village to village. Lord Caitanya as the incarnation of Kåñëa, the
Personality of Godhead, is described secretly but not directly in the
confidential parts of the revealed scriptures, such as the Upaniñads,
Mahäbhärata, Bhägavatam, etc. The devotees of Lord Kåñëa are much attracted by
the saìkértana movement of Lord Caitanya. This avatära of the Lord does not kill
the miscreants, but delivers them by the causeless mercy of the Lord.

TRANSLATION
One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does
not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but
attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna.

PURPORT
The Lord’s descent from His transcendental abode is already explained in the 6th
verse. One who can understand the truth of the appearance of the Personality of
Godhead is already liberated from material bondage, and therefore he returns to
the kingdom of God immediately after quitting this present material body. Such
liberation of the living entity from material bondage is not at all easy. The
impersonalists and the yogés attain liberation only after much trouble and many,
many births. Even then, the liberation they achieve—merging into the impersonal
brahmajyoti of the Lord—is only partial, and there is the risk of returning
again to this material world. But the devotee, simply by understanding the
transcendental nature of the body and activities of the Lord, attains the abode
of the Lord after ending this body and does not run the risk of returning again
to this material world. In the Brahma-saàhitä it is stated that the Lord has
many, many forms and incarnations: advaitam acyutam anädim ananta-rüpam.
Although there are many transcendental forms of the Lord, they are still one and
the same Supreme Personality of Godhead. One has to understand this fact with
conviction, although it is incomprehensible to mundane scholars and empiric
philosophers. As stated in the Vedas:

eko devo nitya-lélänurakto bhakta-vyäpé hådy antarätmä.

"The one Supreme Personality of Godhead is eternally engaged in many, many
transcendental forms in relationships with His unalloyed devotees." This Vedic
version is confirmed in this verse of the Gétä personally by the Lord. He who
accepts this truth on the strength of the authority of the Vedas and of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead and who does not waste time in philosophical
speculations attains the highest perfectional stage of liberation. Simply by
accepting this truth on faith, one can, without a doubt, attain liberation. The
Vedic version, "tattvamasi," is actually applied in this case. Anyone who
understands Lord Kåñëa to be the Supreme, or who says unto the Lord, "You are
the same Supreme Brahman, the Personality of Godhead" is certainly liberated
instantly, and consequently his entrance into the transcendental association of
the Lord is guaranteed. In other words, such a faithful devotee of the Lord
attains perfection, and this is confirmed by the following Vedic assertion:

tam eva viditvätimåtyumeti nänyaù panthä vidyate ayanäya.

One can attain the perfect stage of liberation from birth and death simply by
knowing the Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There is no alternative
because anyone who does not understand Lord Kåñëa as the Supreme Personality of
Godhead is surely in the mode of ignorance. Consequently he will not attain
salvation, simply, so to speak, by licking the outer surface of the bottle of
honey, or by interpreting the Bhagavad-gétä according to mundane scholarship.
Such empiric philosophers may assume very important roles in the material world,
but they are not necessarily eligible for liberation. Such puffed up mundane
scholars have to wait for the causeless mercy of the devotee of the Lord. One
should therefore cultivate Kåñëa consciousness with faith and knowledge, and in
this way attain perfection.

PURPORT
As described above, it is very difficult for a person who is too materially
affected to understand the personal nature of the Supreme Absolute Truth.
Generally, people who are attached to the bodily conception of life are so
absorbed in materialism that it is almost impossible for them to understand that
there is a transcendental body which is imperishable, full of knowledge and
eternally blissful. In the materialistic concept, the body is perishable, full
of ignorance and completely miserable. Therefore, people in general keep this
same bodily idea in mind when they are informed of the personal form of the
Lord. For such materialistic men, the form of the gigantic material
manifestation is supreme. Consequently they consider the Supreme to be
impersonal. And because they are too materially absorbed, the conception of
retaining the personality after liberation from matter frightens them. When they
are informed that spiritual life is also individual and personal, they become
afraid of becoming persons again, and so they naturally prefer a kind of merging
into the impersonal void. Generally, they compare the living entities to the
bubbles of the ocean, which merge into the ocean. That is the highest perfection
of spiritual existence attainable without individual personality. This is a kind
of fearful stage of life, devoid of perfect knowledge of spiritual existence.
Furthermore there are many persons who cannot understand spiritual existence at
all. Being embarassed by so many theories and by contradictions of various types
of philosophical speculation, they become disgusted or angry and foolishly
conclude that there is no supreme cause and that everything is ultimately void.
Such people are in a diseased condition of life. Some people are too materially
attached and therefore do not give attention to spiritual life, some of them
want to merge into the supreme spiritual cause, and some of them disbelieve in
everything, being angry at all sorts of spiritual speculation out of
hopelessness. This last class of men take to the shelter of some kind of
intoxication, and their affective hallucinations are sometimes accepted as
spiritual vision. One has to get rid of all three stages of attachment to the
material world: negligence of spiritual life, fear of a spiritual personal
identity, and the conception of void that underlies the frustration of life. To
get free from these three stages of the material concept of life, one has to
take complete shelter of the Lord, guided by the bona fide spiritual master, and
follow the disciplines and regulative principles of devotional life. The last
stage of the devotional life is called bhäva, or transcendental love of Godhead.

According to Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu, the science of devotional service:

ädau çraddhä tataù sädhu-saìgo ’tha bhajana-kriyä
tato ’nartha-nivåttiù syät tato niñöhä rucis tataù
athäsaktis tato bhävas tataù premäbhyudaïcati
sädhakänäm ayaà premëaù prädurbhäve bhavet kramaù.

"In the beginning one must have a preliminary desire for self-realization. This
will bring one to the stage of trying to associate with persons who are
spiritually elevated. In next stage one becomes initiated by an elevated
spiritual master, and under his instruction the neophyte devotee begins the
process of devotional service. By execution of devotional service under the
guidance of the spiritual master, one becomes free from all material attachment,
attains steadiness in self-realization, and acquires a taste for hearing about
the Absolute Personality of Godhead, Çré Kåñëa. This taste leads one further
forward to attachment for Kåñëa consciousness, which is matured in bhäva, or the
preliminary stage of transcendental love of God. Real love for God is called
premä, the highest perfectional stage of life." In the premä stage there is
constant engagement in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. So, by the
slow process of devotional service, under the guidance of the bona fide
spiritual master, one can attain the highest stage, being freed from all
material attachment, from the fearfulness of one’s individual spiritual
personality, and from the frustrations resulting from void philosophy. Then one
can ultimately attain to the abode of the Supreme Lord.

PURPORT
Eveyone is searching for Kåñëa in the different aspects of His manifestations.
Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is partially realized in His
impersonal brahmajyoti effulgence and as the all-pervading Supersoul dwelling
within everything, including the particles of atoms. But Kåñëa is only fully
realized by His pure devotees. Consequently, Kåñëa is the object of everyone’s
realization, and thus anyone and everyone is satisfied according to one’s desire
to have Him. In the transcendental world also, Kåñëa reciprocates with His pure
devotees in the transcendental attitude, just as the devotee wants Him. One
devotee may want Kåñëa as supreme master, another as his personal friend,
another as his son, and still another as his lover. Kåñëa rewards all the
devotees equally, according to their different intensities of love for Him. In
the material world, the same reciprocations of feelings are there, and they are
equally exchanged by the Lord with the different types of worshipers. The pure
devotees both here and in the transcendental abode associate with Him in person
and are able to render personal service to the Lord and thus derive
transcendental bliss in His loving service. As for those who are impersonalists
and who want to commit spiritual suicide by annihilating the individual
existence of the living entity, Kåñëa helps also by absorbing them into His
effulgence. Such impersonalists do not agree to accept the eternal, blissful
Personality of Godhead; consequently they cannot relish the bliss of
transcendental personal service to the Lord, having extinguished their
individuality. Some of them, who are not situated even in the impersonal
existence, return to this material field to exhibit their dormant desires for
activities. They are not admitted in the spiritual planets, but they are again
given a chance to act on the material planets. For those who are fruitive
workers, the Lord awards the desired results of their prescribed duties, as the
yajïeçvara; and those who are yogés seeking mystic powers are awarded such
powers. In other words, everyone is dependant for success upon His mercy alone,
and all kinds of spiritual processes are but different degrees of success on the
same path. Unless, therefore, one comes to the highest perfection of Kåñëa
consciousness, all attempts remain imperfect, as is stated in the Çrémad
Bhägavatam:

akämaù sarva-kämo vä mokña-käma udäradhéù
tévreëa bhakti-yogena yajeta puruñaà param

"Whether one is without desire [the condition of the devotees], or is desirous
of all fruitive results, or is after liberation, one should with all efforts try
to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead for complete perfection,
culminating in Kåñëa consciousness." (Bhäg. 2.3.10)

There is a great misconception about the gods or demigods of this material
world, and men of less intelligence, although passing as great scholars, take
these demigods to be various forms of the Supreme Lord. Actually, the demigods
are not different forms of God, but they are God’s different parts and parcels.
God is one, and the parts and parcels are many. The Vedas say, nityo nityänäm:
God is one. Éçvaraù paramaù kåñëaù. The Supreme God is one—Kåñëa—and the
demigods are delegated with powers to manage this material world. These demigods
are all living entities (nityänäm) with different grades of material power. They
cannot be equal to the Supreme God—Näräyaëa, Viñëu, or Kåñëa. Anyone who thinks
that God and the demigods are on the same level is called an atheist, or
päñaëòé. Even the great demigods like Brahmä and Çiva cannot be compared to the
Supreme Lord. In fact, the Lord is worshiped by demigods such as Brahmä and Çiva
(çiva-viriïci-nutam). Yet curiously enough there are many human leaders who are
worshiped by foolish men under the misunderstanding of anthropomorphism or
zoomorphism. Iha devatäù denotes a powerful man or demigod of this material
world. But Näräyaëa, Viñëu or Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, does
not belong to this world. He is above, or transcendental to, material creation.
Even Çrépäda Çaìkaräcärya, the leader of the impersonalists, maintains that
Näräyaëa, or Kåñëa, is beyond this material creation. However, foolish people
(håt-aïjana) worship the demigods because they want immediate results. They get
the results, but do not know that results so obtained are temporary and are
meant for less intelligent persons. The intelligent person is in Kåñëa
consciousness, and he has no need to worship the paltry demigods for some
immediate, temporary benefit. The demigods of this material world, as well as
their worshipers, will vanish with the annihilation of this material world. The
boons of the demigods are material and temporary. Both the material worlds and
their inhabitants, including the demigods, and their worshipers, are bubbles in
the cosmic ocean. In this world, however, human society is mad after temporary
things such as the material opulence of possessing land, family and enjoyable
paraphernalia. To achieve such temporary things, they worship the demigods or
powerful men in human society. If a man gets some ministership in the government
by worshiping a political leader, he considers that he has achieved a great
boon. All of them are therefore kowtowing to the so-called leaders or "big guns"
in order to achieve temporary boons, and they indeed achieve such things. Such
foolish men are not interested in Kåñëa consciousness for the permanent solution
to the hardships of material existence. They are all after sense enjoyment, and
to get a little facility for sense enjoyment they are attracted to worship
empowered living entities known as demigods. This verse indicates that people
are rarely interested in Kåñëa consciousness. They are mostly interested in
material enjoyment, and therefore they worship some powerful living entity.

TRANSLATION
According to the three modes of material nature and the work ascribed to them,
the four divisions of human society were created by Me. And, although I am the
creator of this system, you should know that I am yet the non-doer, being
unchangeable.

PURPORT
The Lord is the creator of everything. Everything is born of Him, everything is
sustained by Him, and everything, after annihilation, rests in Him. He is
therefore the creator of the four divisions of the social order, beginning with
the intelligent class of men, technically called brähmaëas due to their being
situated in the mode of goodness. Next is the administrative class, technically
called the kñatriyas due to their being situated in the mode of passion. The
mercantile men, called the vaiçyas, are situated in the mixed modes of passion
and ignorance, and the çüdras, or laborer class, are situated in the ignorant
mode of material nature. In spite of His creating the four divisions of human
society, Lord Kåñëa does not belong to any of these divisions, because He is not
one of the conditioned souls, a section of whom form human society. Human
society is similar to any other animal society, but to elevate men from the
animal status, the abovementioned divisions are created by the Lord for the
systematic development of Kåñëa consciousness. The tendency of a particular man
toward work is determined by the modes of material nature which he has acquired.
Such symptoms of life, according to different modes of material nature, are
described in the Eighteenth Chapter of this book. A person in Kåñëa
consciousness, however, is above even the brähmaëas, because a brähmaëa by
quality is supposed to know about Brahman, the Supreme Absolute Truth. Most of
them approach the impersonal Brahman manifestation of Lord Kåñëa, but only a man
who transcends the limited knowledge of a brähmaëa and reaches the knowledge of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Çré Kåñëa, becomes a person in Kåñëa
consciousness—or, in other words, a Vaiñëava. Kåñëa consciousness includes
knowledge of all different plenary expansions of Kåñëa, namely Räma, Nåsiàha,
Varäha, etc. However, as Kåñëa is transcendental to this system of the four
divisions of human society, a person in Kåñëa consciousness is also
transcendental to all divisions of human society, whether we consider the
divisions of community, nation or species.

TRANSLATION
There is no work that affects Me; nor do I aspire for the fruits of action. One

fruitive reactions of work.

PURPORT
As there are constitutional laws in the material world stating that the king can
do no wrong, or that the king is not subject to the state laws, similarly the
Lord, although He is the creator of this material world, is not affected by the
activities of the material world. He creates and remains aloof from the
creation, whereas the living entities are entangled in the fruitive results of
material activities because of their propensity for lording it over material
resources. The proprietor of an establishment is not responsible for the right
and wrong activities of the workers, but the workers are themselves responsible.
The living entities are engaged in their respective activities of sense
gratification, and these activities are not ordained by the Lord. For
advancement of sense gratification, the living entities are engaged in the work
of this world, and they aspire to heavenly happiness after death. The Lord,
being full in Himself, has no attraction for so-called heavenly happiness. The
heavenly demigods are only His engaged servants. The proprietor never desires
the low-grade happiness such as the workers may desire. He is aloof from the
material actions and reactions. For example, the rains are not responsible for
different types of vegetation that appear on the earth, although without such
rains there is no possibility of vegetative growth. Vedic småti confirms this
fact as follows:

nimitta-mätram eväsau såjyänäà sarga-karmaëi
pradhäna-käraëé-bhütä yato vai såjya-çaktayaù.

In the material creations, the Lord is only the supreme cause. The immediate
cause is material nature by which the cosmic manifestation is visible. The
created beings are of many varieties, such as the demigods, human beings and
lower animals, and all of them are subject to the reactions of their past good
or bad activities. The Lord only gives them the proper facilities for such
activities and the regulations of the modes of nature, but He is never
responsible for their past and present activities. In the Vedänta-sütras it is
confirmed that the Lord is never partial to any living entity. The living entity
is responsible for his own acts. The Lord only gives him facilities, through the
agency of material nature, the external energy. Anyone who is fully conversant
with all the intricacies of this law of karma, or fruitive activities, does not
become affected by the results of his activities. In other words, the person who
understands this transcendental nature of the Lord is an experienced man in
Kåñëa consciousness, and thus he is never subjected to the laws of karma. One
who does not know the transcendental nature of the Lord and who thinks that the
activities of the Lord are aimed at fruitive results, as are the activities of
the ordinary living entities, certainly becomes entangled himself in fruitive
reaction. But one who knows the Supreme Truth is a liberated soul fixed in Kåñëa
consciousness.

All the liberated souls in ancient times acted with this understanding and so

this divine consciousness.

PURPORT
There are two classes of men. Some of them are full of polluted material things
within their hearts, and some of them are materially free. Kåñëa consciousness
is equally beneficial for both of these persons. Those who are full of dirty
things can take to the line of Kåñëa consciousness for a gradual cleansing
process, following the regulative principles of devotional service. Those who
are already cleansed of the impurities may continue to act in the same Kåñëa
consciousness so that others may follow their exemplary activities and thereby
be benefitted. Foolish persons or neophytes in Kåñëa consciousness often want to
retire from activities without having knowledge of Kåñëa consciousness. Arjuna’s
desire to retire from activities on the battlefield was not approved by the
Lord. One need only know how to act. To retire from the activities of Kåñëa
consciousness and to sit aloof making a show of Kåñëa consciousness; is less
important than actually engaging in the field of activities for the sake of
Kåñëa. Arjuna is here advised to act in Kåñëa consciousness, following in the
footsteps of the Lord’s previous disciples, such as the sun-god Vivasvän, as
mentioned hereinbefore. The Supreme Lord knows all His past activities, as well
as those of persons who acted in Kåñëa consciousness in the past. Therefore He
recommends the acts of the sun-god, who learned this art from the Lord some
millions of years before. All such students of Lord Kåñëa are mentioned here as
past liberated persons, engaged in the discharge of duties allotted by Kåñëa.

TRANSLATION
Even the intelligent are bewildered in determining what is action and what is
inaction. Now I shall explain to you what action is, knowing which you shall be
liberated from all sins.

PURPORT
Action in Kåñëa consciousness has to be executed in accord with the examples of
previous bona fide devotees. This is recommended in the 15th verse. Why such
action should not be independant will be explained in the text to follow.

To act in Kåñëa consciousness, one has to follow the leadership of authorized
persons who are in a line of disciplic succession as explained in the beginning
of this chapter. The system of Kåñëa consciousness was first narrated to the
sun-god, the sun-god explained it to his son Manu, Manu explained it to his son
Ikñväku, and the system is current on this earth from that very remote time.
Therefore, one has to follow in the footsteps of previous authorities in the
line of disciplic succession. Otherwise even the most intelligent men will be
bewildered regarding the standard actions of Kåñëa consciousness. For this
reason, the Lord decided to instruct Arjuna in Kåñëa consciousness directly.
Because of the direct instruction of the Lord to Arjuna, anyone who follows in
the footsteps of Arjuna is certainly not bewildered.

It is said that one cannot ascertain the ways of religion simply by imperfect
experimental knowledge. Actually, the principles of religion can only be laid
down by the Lord Himself. Dharmaà hi säkñät-bhagavat-praëétam. No one can
manufacture a religious principle by imperfect speculation. One must follow in
the footsteps of great authorities like Brahmä, Çiva, Närada, Manu, Kumära,
Kapila, Prahläda, Bhéñma, Çukadeva Gosvämé, Yamaräja, Janaka, etc. By mental
speculation one cannot ascertain what is religion or self-realization.
Therefore, out of causeless mercy to His devotees, the Lord explains directly to
Arjuna what action is and what inaction is. Only action performed in Kåñëa
consciousness can deliver a person from the entanglement of material existence.

TRANSLATION
The intricacies of action are very hard to understand. Therefore one should know
properly what action is, what forbidden action is, and what inaction is.

If one is serious about liberation from material bondage, one has to understand
the distinctions between action, inaction and unauthorized actions. One has to
apply oneself to such an analysis of action, reaction and perverted actions
because it is a very difficult subject matter. To understand Kåñëa consciousness
and action according to the modes, one has to learn one’s relationship with the
Supreme; i.e., one who has learned perfectly knows that every living entity is
the eternal servitor of the Lord and that consequently one has to act in Kåñëa
consciousness. The entire Bhagavad-gétä is directed toward this conclusion. Any
other conclusions, against this consciousness and its attendant reactions, are
vikarmas, or prohibitive actions. To understand all this one has to associate
with authorities in Kåñëa consciousness and learn the secret from them; this is
as good as learning from the Lord directly. Otherwise, even the most intelligent
person will be bewildered.

intelligent; manuñyeñu—in human society; saù—he; yuktaù—is in the transcendental

TRANSLATION
One who sees inaction in action, and action in inaction, is intelligent among
men, and he is in the tranecendental position, although engaged in all sorts of
activities.

PURPORT
A person acting in Kåñëa consciousness is naturally free from the bonds of
karma. His activities are all performed for Kåñëa; therefore he does not enjoy
or suffer any of the effects of work. Consequently he is intelligent in human
society, even though he is engaged in all sorts of activities for Kåñëa. Akarma
means without reaction to work. The impersonalist ceases fruitive activities out
of fear, so that the resultant action may not be a stumbling block on the path
of self-realization, but the personalist knows rightly his position as the
eternal servitor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore he engages
himself in the activities of Kåñëa consciousness. Because everything is done for
Kåñëa, he enjoys only transcendental happiness in the discharge of this service.
Those who are engaged in this process are known to be without desire for
personal sense gratification. The sense of eternal servitorship to Kåñëa makes
one immune to all sorts of reactionary elements of work.

TRANSLATION
One is understood to be in full knowledge whose every act is devoid of desire
for sense gratification. He is said by sages to be a worker whose fruitive
action is burned up by the fire of perfect knowledge.

PURPORT
Only a person in full knowledge can understand the activities of a person in
Kåñëa consciousness. Because the person in Kåñëa consciousness is devoid of all
kinds of sense-gratificatory propensities, it is to be understood that he has
burned up the reactions of his work by perfect knowledge of his constitutional
position as the eternal servitor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is
actually learned who has attained to such perfection of knowledge. Development
of this knowledge of the eternal servitorship of the Lord is compared to fire.
Such a fire, once kindled, can burn up all kinds of reactions to work.

TRANSLATION
Abandoning all attachment to the results of his activities, ever satisfied and
independant, he performs no fruitive action, although engaged in all kinds of
undertakings.

PURPORT
This freedom from the bondage of actions is possible only in Kåñëa consciousness
when one is doing everything for Kåñëa. A Kåñëa conscious person acts out of
pure love for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore he has no
attraction for the results of the action. He is not even attached to his
personal maintenance, for everything is left to Kåñëa. Nor is he anxious to
secure things, nor to protect things already in his possession. He does his duty
to his best ability and leaves everything to Kåñëa. Such an unattached person is
always free from the resultant reactions of good and bad; it is as though he
were not doing anything. This is the sign of akarma, or actions without fruitive
reactions. Any other action, therefore, devoid of Kåñëa consciousness, is
binding upon the worker, and that is the real aspect of vikarma, as explained
hereinbefore.

TRANSLATION
Such a man of understanding acts with mind and intelligence perfectly
controlled, gives up all sense of proprietorship over his possessions and acts
only for the bare necessities of life. Thus working, he is not affected by
sinful reactions.

PURPORT
A Kåñëa conscious person does not expect good or bad results in his activities.
His mind and intelligence are fully controlled. He knows that he is part and
parcel of the Supreme, and therefore the part played by him, as a part and
parcel of the whole, is not his by choice but is chosen for him by the Supreme
and is done only through His agency. When the hand moves, it does not move out
of its own accord, but by the endeavor of the whole body. A Kåñëa conscious
person is always dovetailed with the supreme desire, for he has no desire for
personal sense gratification. He moves exactly like a part of a machine. As a
machine part requires oiling and cleaning for maintenance, similarly, a Kåñëa
conscious man maintains himself by his work just to remain fit for action in the
transcendental loving service of the Lord. He is therefore immune to all the
reactions of his endeavors. Like an animal, he has no proprietorship even over
his own body. A cruel proprietor of an animal sometimes kills the animal in his
possession, yet the animal does not protest. Nor does it have any real
independence. A Kåñëa conscious person, fully engaged in self-realization, has
very little time to falsely possess any material object. For maintaining body
and soul, he does not require unfair means of accumulating money. He does not,
therefore, become contaminated by such material sins. He is free from all
reactions to his actions.

TRANSLATION
He who is satisfied with gain which comes of its own accord, who is free from
duality and does not envy, who is steady both in success and failure, is never
entangled, although performing actions.

PURPORT
A Kåñëa conscious person does not make much endeavor even to maintain his body.
He is satisfied with gains which are obtained of their own accord. He neither
begs nor borrows, but he labors honestly as far as is in his power, and is
satisfied with whatever is obtained by his own honest labor. He is therefore
independant in his livelihood. He does not allow anyone’s service to hamper his
own service in Kåñëa consciousness. However, for the service of the Lord he can
participate in any kind of action without being disturbed by the duality of the
material world. The duality of the material world is felt in terms of heat and
cold, or misery and happiness. A Kåñëa conscious person is above duality because
he does not hesitate to act in any way for the satisfaction of Kåñëa. Therefore
he is steady both in success and in failure. These signs are visible when one is
fully in transcendental knowledge.

TRANSLATION
The work of a man who is unattached to the modes of material nature and who is
fully situated in transcendental knowledge merges entirely into transcendence.

PURPORT
Becoming fully Kåñëa conscious, one is freed from all dualities and thus is free
from the contaminations of the material modes. He can become liberated because
he knows his constitutional position in relationship with Kåñëa; and thus his
mind cannot be drawn from Kåñëa consciousness. Consequently, whatever he does,
he does for Kåñëa, who is the primeval Viñëu. Therefore, all his works are
technically sacrifices because sacrifice involves satisfying the Supreme Person,
Kåñëa. The resultant reactions to all such work certainly merge into
transcendence, and one does not suffer material effects.

TRANSLATION
A person who is fully absorbed in Kåñëa consciousness is sure to attain the
spiritual kingdom because of his full contribution to spiritual activities, in
which the consummation is absolute and that which is offered is of the same
spiritual nature.

PURPORT
How activities in Kåñëa consciousness can lead one ultimately to the spiritual
goal is described here. There are various activities in Kåñëa consciousness, and
all of them will be described in the following verses. But, for the present,
just the principle of Kåñëa consciousness is described. A conditioned soul,
entangled in material contamination, is sure to act in the material atmosphere,
and yet he has to get out of such an environment. The process by which the
conditioned soul can get out of the material atmosphere is Kåñëa consciousness.
For example, a patient who is suffering from a disorder of the bowels due to
overindulgence in milk products is cured by another milk product, namely curds.
The materially absorbed conditioned soul can be cured by Kåñëa consciousness as
set forth here in the Gétä. This process is generally known as yajïa, or
activities (sacrifices) simply meant for the satisfaction of Viñëu or Kåñëa. The
more the activities of the material world are performed in Kåñëa consciousness,
or for Viñëu only, the more the atmosphere becomes spiritualized by complete
absorption. Brahman means spiritual. The Lord is spiritual, and the rays of His
transcendental body are called brahmajyoti, His spiritual effulgence. Everything
that exists is situated in that brahmajyoti, but when the jyoti is covered by
illusion (mäyä) or sense gratification, it is called material. This material
veil can be removed at once by Kåñëa consciousness; thus the offering for the
sake of Kåñëa consciousness, the consuming agent of such an offering or
contribution; the process of consumption, the contributor, and the result
are—all combined together—Brahman, or the Absolute Truth. The Absolute Truth
covered by mäyä is called matter. Matter dovetailed for the cause of the
Absolute Truth regains its spiritual quality. Kåñëa consciousness is the process
of converting the illusory consciousness into Brahman, or the Supreme. When the
mind is fully absorbed in Kåñëa consciousness, it is said to be in samädhi, or
trance. Anything done in such transcendental consciousness is called yajïa, or
sacrifice for the Absolute. In that condition of spiritual consciousness, the
contributor, the contribution, the consumption, the performer or leader of the
performance, and the result or ultimate gain—everything—becomes one in the
Absolute, the Supreme Brahman. That is the method of Kåñëa consciousness.

As described above, a person engaged in discharging duties in Kåñëa
consciousness is also called a perfect yogé or a first-class mystic. But there
are others also, who perform similar sacrifices in the worship of demigods, and
still others who sacrifice to the Supreme Brahman, or the impersonal feature of
the Supreme Lord. So there are different kinds of sacrifices in terms of
different categories. Such different categories of sacrifice by different types
of performers only superficially demark varieties of sacrifice. Factual
sacrifice means to satisfy the Supreme Lord, Viñëu, who is also known as Yajïa.
All the different varieties of sacrifice can be placed within two primary
divisions: namely, sacrifice of worldly possessions and sacrifice in pursuit of
transcendental knowledge. Those who are in Kåñëa consciousness sacrifice all
material possessions for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord, while others, who
want some temporary material happiness, sacrifice their material possessions to
satisfy demigods such as Indra, the sun-god, etc. And others, who are
impersonalists, sacrifice their identity by merging into the existence of
impersonal Brahman. The demigods are powerful living entities appointed by the
Supreme Lord for the maintenance and supervision of all material functions like
the heating, watering and lighting of the universe. Those who are interested in
material benefits worship the demigods by various sacrifices according to the
Vedic rituals. They are called bahv-éçvara-vädé, or believers in many gods. But
others, who worship the impersonal feature of the Absolute Truth and regard the
forms of the demigods as temporary, sacrifice their individual selves in the
supreme fire and thus end their individual existences by merging into the
existence of the Supreme. Such impersonalists spend their time in philosophical
speculation to understand the transcendental nature of the Supreme. In other
words, the fruitive workers sacrifice their material possessions for material
enjoyment, whereas the impersonalist sacrifices his material designations with a
view to merging into the existence of the Supreme. For the impersonalist, the
fire altar of sacrifice is the Supreme Brahman, and the offering is the self
being consumed by the fire of Brahman. The Kåñëa conscious person, like Arjuna,
however, sacrifices everything for the satisfaction of Kåñëa, and thus all his
material possessions as well as his own self—everything—is sacrificed for Kåñëa.
Thus, he is the first-class yogé; but he does not lose his individual existence.

TRANSLATION
Some of them sacrifice the hearing process and the senses in the fire of the
controlled mind, and others sacrifice the objects of the senses, such as sound,
in the fire of sacrifice.

PURPORT
The four divisions of human life, namely the brahmacäré, the gåhastha, the
vänaprastha, and the sannyäsé, are all meant to help men become perfect yogés or
transcendentalists. Since human life is not meant for our enjoying sense
gratification like the animals, the four orders of human life are so arranged
that one may become perfect in spiritual life. The brahmacärés, or students
under the care of a bona fide spiritual master, control the mind by abstaining
from sense gratification. They are referred to in this verse as sacrificing the
hearing process and the senses in the fire of the controlled mind. A brahmacäré
hears only words concerning Kåñëa consciousness; hearing is the basic principle
for understanding, and therefore the pure brahmacäré engages fully in harer
nämänukértanam—chanting and hearing the glories of the Lord. He restrains
himself from the vibrations of material sounds, and his hearing is engaged in
the transcendental sound vibration of Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa. Similarly, the
householders, who have some license for sense gratification, perform such acts
with great restraint. Sex life, intoxication and meat eating are general
tendencies of human society, but a regulated householder does not indulge in
unrestricted sex life and other sense gratifications. Marriage on principles of
religious life is therefore current in all civilized human society because that
is the way for restricted sex life. This restricted, unattached sex life is also
a kind of yajïa because the restricted householder sacrifices his general
tendency toward sense gratification for higher transcendental life.

Those who are interested in self-realization, in terms of mind and sense

PURPORT
The yoga system conceived by Pataïjali is referred to herein. In the Yoga-sütra
of Pataïjali, the soul is called pratyag-ätmä and parag-ätmä. As long as the
soul is attached to sense enjoyment, it is called parag-ätmä. The soul is
subjected to the functions of ten kinds of air at work within the body, and this
is perceived through the breathing system. The Pätaïjala system of yoga
instructs one on how to control the functions of the body’s air in a technical
manner so that ultimately all the functions of the air within become favorable
for purifying the soul of material attachment. According to this yoga system,
pratyag ätmä is the ultimate goal. This pratyag ätmä is a withdrawal from
activities in matter. The senses interact with the sense objects, like the ear
for hearing, eyes for seeing, nose for smelling, tongue for tasting, hand for
touching, and all of them are thus engaged in activities outside the self. They
are called the functions of the präëa-väyu. The apäna-väyu goes downwards,
vyäna-väyu acts to shrink and expand, samäna-väyu adjusts equilibrium,
udäna-väyu goes upwards—and when one is enlightened, one engages all these in
searching for self-realization.

TRANSLATION
There are others who, enlightened by sacrificing their material possessions in
severe austerities, take strict vows and practice the yoga of eightfold
mysticism, and others study the Vedas for the advancement of transcendental
knowledge.

PURPORT
These sacrifices may be fitted into various divisions. There are persons who are
sacrificing their possessions in the form of various kinds of charities. In
India, the rich mercantile community or princely orders open various kinds of
charitable institutions like dharmaçälä, anna-kñetra, atithi-çälä, anathalaya,
vidyäpéöha, etc. In other countries, too, there are many hospitals, old age
homes and similar charitable foundations meant for distributing food, education
and medical treatment free to the poor. All these charitable activities are
called dravyamaya-yajïa. There are others who, for higher elevation in life or
for promotion to higher planets within the universe, voluntarily accept many
kinds of austerities such as candräyana and cäturmäsya. These processes entail
severe vows for conducting life under certain rigid rules. For example, under
the cäturmäsya vow the candidate does not shave for four months during the year
(July to October), he does not eat certain foods, does not eat twice in a day
and does not leave home. Such sacrifice of the comforts of life is called
tapomaya-yajïa. There are still others who engage themselves in different kinds
of mystic yogas like the Pataïjali system (for merging into the existence of the
Absolute), or haöha-yoga or añöäìga-yoga (for particular perfections). And some
travel to all the sanctified places of pilgrimage. All these practices are
called yoga-yajïa, sacrifice for a certain type of perfection in the material
world. There are others who engage themselves in the studies of different Vedic
literatures, specifically the Upaniñads and Vedänta-sütras, or the säìkhya
philosophy. All of these are called svädhyäya-yajïa, or engagement in the
sacrifice of studies. All these yogés are faithfully engaged in different types
of sacrifice and are seeking a higher status of life. Kåñëa consciousness, is,
however, different from these because it is the direct service of the Supreme
Lord. Kåñëa consciousness cannot be attained by any one of the above-mentioned
types of sacrifices but can be attained only by the mercy of the Lord and His
bona fide devotee. Therefore, Kåñëa consciousness is transcendental.

TRANSLATION
And there are even others who are inclined to the process of breath restraint to
remain in trance, and they practice stopping the movement of the outgoing breath
into the incoming, and incoming breath into the outgoing, and thus at last
remain in trance, stopping all breathing. Some of them, curtailing the eating
process, offer the outgoing breath into itself, as a sacrifice.

PURPORT
This system of yoga for controlling the breathing process is called präëäyäma,
and in the beginning it is practiced in the haöha-yoga system through different
sitting postures. All of these processes are recommended for controlling the
senses and for advancement in spiritual realization. This practice involves
controlling the air within the body to enable simultaneous passage in opposite
directions. The apäna air goes downward, and the präëa air goes up. The
präëäyäma yogé practices breathing the opposite way until the currents are
neutralized into püraka, equilibrium. Similarly, when the exhaled breathing is
offered to inhaled breathing, it is called recaka. When both air currents are
completely stopped, it is called kumbhaka-yoga. By practice of kumbhaka-yoga,
the yogés increase the duration of life by many, many years. A Kåñëa conscious
person, however, being always situated in the transcendental loving service of
the Lord, automatically becomes the controller of the senses. His senses, being
always engaged in the service of Kåñëa, have no chance of becoming otherwise
engaged. So at the end of life, he is naturally transferred to the
transcendental plane of Lord Kåñëa; consequently he makes no attempt to increase
his longevity. He is at once raised to the platform of liberation. A Kåñëa
conscious person begins from the transcendental stage, and he is constantly in
that consciousness. Therefore, there is no falling down, and ultimately he
enters into the abode of the Lord without delay. The practice of reduced eating
is automatically done when one eats only Kåñëa prasädam, or food which is
offered first to the Lord. Reducing the eating process is very helpful in the
matter of sense control. And without sense control there is no possibility of
getting out of the material entanglement.

TRANSLATION
All these performers who know the meaning of sacrifice become cleansed of sinful
reaction, and, having tasted the nectar of the remnants of such sacrifice, they
go to the supreme eternal atmosphere.

PURPORT
From the foregoing explanation of differents types of sacrifice (namely
sacrifice of one’s possessions, study of the Vedas or philosophical doctrines,
and performance of the yoga system), it is found that the common aim of all is
to control the senses. Sense gratification is the root cause of material
existence; therefore, unless and until one is situated on a platform apart from
sense gratification, there is no chance of being elevated to the eternal
platform of full knowledge, full bliss and full life. This platform is in the
eternal atmosphere, or Brahman atmosphere. All the above-mentioned sacrifices
help one to become cleansed of the sinful reactions of material existence. By
this advancement in life, one not only becomes happy and opulent in this life,
but also, at the end, he enters into the eternal kingdom of God, either merging
into the impersonal Brahman or associating with the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, Kåñëa.

TRANSLATION
O best of the Kuru dynasty, without sacrifice one can never live happily on this
planet or in this life: what then of the next?

PURPORT
Whatever form of material existence one is in, one is invariably ignorant of his
real situation. In other words, existence in the material world is due to the
multiple reactions to our sinful lives. Ignorance is the cause of sinful life,
and sinful life is the cause of one’s dragging on in material existence. The
human form of life is the only loophole by which one may get out of this
entanglement. The Vedas, therefore, give us a chance for escape by pointing out
the paths of religion, economic comfort, regulated sense gratification and, at
last, the means to get out of the miserable condition entirely. The path of
religion, or the different kinds of sacrifice recommended above, automatically
solves our economic problems. By performance of yajïa we can have enough food,
enough milk, etc.—even if there is a so-called increase of population. When the
body is fully supplied, naturally the next stage is to satisfy the senses. The
Vedas prescribe, therefore, sacred marriage for regulated sense gratification.
Thereby one is gradually elevated to the platform of release from material
bondage, and the highest perfection of liberated life is to associate with the
Supreme Lord. Perfection is achieved by performance of yajïa (sacrifice), as
described above. Now, if a person is not inclined to perform yajïa according to
the Vedas, how can he expect a happy life? There are different grades of
material comforts in different heavenly planets, and in all cases there is
immense happiness for persons engaged in different kinds of yajïa. But the
highest kind of happiness that a man can achieve is to be promoted to the
spiritual planets by practice of Kåñëa consciousness. A life of Kåñëa
consciousness is therefore the solution to all the problems of material
existence.

All these different types of sacrifice are approved by the Vedas, and all of

liberated.

PURPORT
Different types of sacrifice, as discussed above, are mentioned in the Vedas to
suit the different types of worker. Because men are so deeply absorbed in the
bodily concept, these sacrifices are so arranged that one can work either with
the body, the mind, or the intelligence. But all of them are recommended for
ultimately bringing about liberation from the body. This is confirmed by the
Lord herewith from His own mouth.

TRANSLATION
O chastiser of the enemy, the sacrifice of knowledge is greater than the
sacrifice of material possessions. O son of Påthä, after all, the sacrifice of
work culminates in transcendental knowledge.

PURPORT
The purpose of all sacrifices is to arrive at the status of complete knowledge,
then to gain release from material miseries, and, ultimately, to engage in
loving transcendental service to the Supreme Lord (Kåñëa consciousness).
Nonetheless, there is a mystery about all these different activities of
sacrifice, and one should know this mystery. Sacrifices sometimes take different
forms according to the particular faith of the performer. When one’s faith
reaches the stage of transcendental knowledge, the performer of sacrifices
should be considered more advanced than those who simply sacrifice material
possessions without such knowledge, for without attainment of knowledge,
sacrifices remain on the material platform and bestow no spiritual benefit. Real
knowledge culminates in Kåñëa consciousness, the highest stage of transcendental
knowledge. Without the elevation of knowledge, sacrifices are simply material
activities. When, however, they are elevated to the level of transcendental
knowledge, all such activities enter onto the spiritual platform. Depending on
differences in consciousness, sacrificial activities are sometimes called
karma-käëòa, fruitive activities, and sometimes jïäna-käëòa, knowledge in the
pursuit of truth. It is better when the end is knowledge.

TRANSLATION
Just try to learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master. Inquire from him
submissively and render service unto him. The self-realized soul can impart
knowledge unto you because he has seen the truth.

PURPORT
The path of spiritual realization is undoubtedly difficult. The Lord therefore
advises us to approach a bona fide spiritual master in the line of disciplic
succession from the Lord Himself. No one can be a bona fide spiritual master
without following this principle of disciplic succession. The Lord is the
original spiritual master, and a person in the disciplic succession can convey
the message of the Lord as it is to his disciple. No one can be spiritually
realized by manufacturing his own process, as is the fashion of the foolish
pretenders. The Bhägavatam says: dharmaà hi säkñäd-bhagavat-praëétam—the path of
religion is directly enunciated by the Lord. Therefore, mental speculation or
dry arguments cannot help one progress in spiritual life. One has to approach a
bona fide spiritual master to receive the knowledge. Such a spiritual master
should be accepted in full surrender, and one should serve the spiritual master
like a menial servant, without false prestige. Satisfaction of the self-realized
spiritual master is the secret of advancement in spiritual life. Inquiries and
submission constitute the proper combination for spiritual understanding. Unless
there is submission and service, inquiries from the learned spiritual master
will not be effective. One must be able to pass the test of the spiritual
master, and when he sees the genuine desire of the disciple, he automatically
blesses the disciple with genuine spiritual understanding. In this verse, both
blind following and absurd inquiries are condemned. One should not only hear
submissively from the spiritual master; but one must also get a clear
understanding from him, in submission and service and inquiries. A bona fide
spiritual master is by nature very kind toward the disciple. Therefore when the
student is submissive and is always ready to render service, the reciprocation
of knowledge and inquiries becomes perfect.

TRANSLATION
And when you have thus learned the truth, you will know that all living beings
are but part of Me—and that they are in Me, and are Mine.

PURPORT
The result of receiving knowledge from a self-realized soul, or one who knows
things as they are, is learning that all living beings are parts and parcels of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Çré Kåñëa. The sense of a separated
existence from Kåñëa is called mäyä (mä—not, yä—this). Some think that we have
nothing to do with Kåñëa, that Kåñëa is only a great historical personality and
that the Absolute is the impersonal Brahman. Factually, as it is stated in the
Bhagavad-gétä, this impersonal Brahman is the personal effulgence of Kåñëa.
Kåñëa, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the cause of everything. In the
Brahma-saàhitä it is clearly stated that Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, the cause of all causes. Even the millions of incarnations are only His
different expansions. Similarly, the living entities are also expansions of
Kåñëa. The Mäyävädé philosophers wrongly think that Kåñëa loses His own separate
existence in His many expansions. This thought is material in nature. We have
experience in the material world that a thing, when fragmentally distributed,
loses its own original identity. But the Mäyävädé philosophers fail to
understand that Absolute means that one plus one is equal to one, and that one
minus one is also equal to one. This is the case in the absolute world.

For want of sufficient knowledge in the absolute science, we are now covered
with illusion, and therefore we think that we are separate from Kåñëa. Although
we are separated parts of Kåñëa, we are nevertheless not different from Him. The
bodily difference of the living entities is mäyä, or not actual fact. We are all
meant to satisfy Kåñëa. By mäyä alone Arjuna thought that the temporary bodily
relationship with his kinsmen was more important than his eternal spiritual
relationship with Kåñëa. The whole teaching of the Gétä is targetted toward this
end: that a living being, as His eternal servitor, cannot be separated from
Kåñëa, and his sense of being an identity apart from Kåñëa is called mäyä. The
living entities, as separate parts and parcels of the Supreme, have a purpose to
fulfill. Having forgotten that purpose, since time immemorial they are situated
in different bodies, as men, animals, demigods, etc. Such bodily differences
arise from forgetfulness of the transcendental service of the Lord. But when one
is engaged in transcendental service through Kåñëa consciousness, one becomes at
once liberated from this illusion. One can acquire such pure knowledge only from
the bona fide spiritual master and thereby avoid the delusion that the living
entity is equal to Kåñëa. Perfect knowledge is that the Supreme Soul, Kåñëa, is
the supreme shelter for all living entities, and giving up such shelter, the
living entities are deluded by the material energy, imagining themselves to have
a separate identity. Thus, under different standards of material identity, they
become forgetful of Kåñëa. When, however, such deluded living entities become
situated in Kåñëa consciousness, it is to be understood that they are on the
path of liberation, as confirmed in the Bhägavatam: muktir hitvänyathä rüpaà
svarüpeëa vyavasthitiù. Liberation means to be situated in one’s constitutional
position as the eternal servitor of Kåñëa (Kåñëa consciousness).

Even if you are considered to be the most sinful of all sinners, when you are

PURPORT
Proper understanding of one’s constitutional position in relationship to Kåñëa
is so nice that it can at once lift one from the struggle for existence which
goes on in the ocean of nescience. This material world is sometimes regarded as
an ocean of nescience and sometimes as a blazing forest. In the ocean, however
expert a swimmer one may be, the struggle for existence is very severe. If
someone comes forward and lifts the struggling swimmer from the ocean, he is the
greatest savior. Perfect knowledge, received from the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, is the path of liberation. The boat of Kåñëa consciousness is very
simple, but at the same time the most sublime.

PURPORT
Perfect knowledge of self and Superself and of their relationship is compared
herein to fire. This fire not only burns up all reactions to impious activities,
but also all reactions to pious activities, turning them to ashes. There are
many stages of reaction: reaction in the making, reaction fructifying, reaction
already achieved, and reaction a priori. But knowledge of the constitutional
position of the living entity burns everything to ashes. When one is in complete
knowledge, all reactious, both a priori and a posteriori, are consumed. In the
Vedas it is stated: ubhe uhaivaiña ete taraty amåtaù sädhv-asädhüné: "One
overcomes both the pious and impious interactions of work."

In this world, there is nothing so sublime and pure as transcendental knowledge.
Such knowledge is the mature fruit of all mysticism. And one who has achieved
this enjoys the self within himself in due course of time.

PURPORT
When we speak of transcendental knowledge, we do so in terms of spiritual
understanding. As such, there is nothing so sublime and pure as transcendental
knowledge. Ignorance is the cause of our bondage, and knowledge is the cause of
our liberation. This knowledge is the mature fruit of devotional service, and
when one is situated in transcendental knowledge, he need not search for peace
elsewhere, for he enjoys peace within himself. In other words, this knowledge
and peace are culminated in Kåñëa consciousness. That is the last word in the
Bhagavad-gétä.

TRANSLATION
A faithful man who is absorbed in transcendental knowledge and who subdues his
senses quickly attains the supreme spiritual peace.

PURPORT
Such knowledge in Kåñëa consciousness can be achieved by a faithful person who
believes firmly in Kåñëa. One is called a faithful man who thinks that, simply
by acting in Kåñëa consciousness, he can attain the highest perfection. This
faith is attained by the discharge of devotional service, and by chanting "Hare
Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare
Hare," which cleanses one’s heart of all material dirt. Over and above this, one
should control the senses. A person who is faithful to Kåñëa and who controls
the senses can easily attain perfection in the knowledge of Kåñëa consciousness
without delay.

TRANSLATION
But ignorant and faithless persons who doubt the revealed scriptures do not
attain God consciousness. For the doubting soul there is happiness neither in
this world nor in the next.

PURPORT
Out of many standard and authoritative revealed scriptures, the Bhagavad-gétä is
the best. Persons who are almost like animals have no faith in, or knowledge of,
the standard revealed scriptures; and some, even though they have knowledge of,
or can cite passages from, the revealed scriptures, have actually no faith in
these words. And even though others may have faith in scriptures like
Bhagavad-gétä, they do not believe in or worship the Personality of Godhead, Çré
Kåñëa. Such persons cannot have any standing in Kåñëa consciousness. They fall
down. Out of all the abovementioned persons, those who have no faith and are
always doubtful make no progress at all. Men without faith in God and His
revealed word find no good in this world, nor in the next. For them there is no
happiness whatsoever. One should therefore follow the principles of revealed
scriptures with faith and thereby be raised to the platform of knowledge. Only
this knowledge will help one become promoted to the transcendental platform of
spiritual understanding. In other words, doubtful persons have no status
whatsoever in spiritual emancipation. One should therefore follow in the
footsteps of great äcäryas who are in the disciplic succession and thereby
attain success.

Therefore, one who has renounced the fruits of his action, whose doubts are
destroyed by transcendental knowledge, and who is situated firmly in the self,
is not bound by works, O conqueror of riches.

PURPORT
One who follows the instruction of the Gétä, as it is imparted by the Lord, the
Personality of Godhead Himself, becomes free from all doubts by the grace of
transcendental knowledge. He, as a part and parcel of the Lord, in full Kåñëa
consciousness, is already established in self-knowledge. As such, he is
undoubtedly above bondage to action.

Therefore the doubts which have arisen in your heart out of ignorance should be
slashed by the weapon of knowledge. Armed with yoga, O Bhärata, stand and fight.

PURPORT
The yoga system instructed in this chapter is called sanätana-yoga, or eternal
activities performed by the living entity. This yoga has two divisions of
sacrificial actions: one is called sacrifice of one’s material possessions, and
the other is called knowledge of self, which is pure spiritual activity. If
sacrifice of one’s material possessions is not dovetailed for spiritual
realization, then such sacrifice becomes material. But one who performs such
sacrifices with a spiritual objective, or in devotional service, makes a perfect
sacrifice. When we come to spiritual activities, we find that these are also
divided into two: namely, understanding of one’s own self (or one’s
constitutional position), and the truth regarding the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. One who follows the path of the Gétä as it is can very easily
understand these two important divisions of spiritual knowledge. For him there
is no difficulty in obtaining perfect knowledge of the self as part and parcel
of the Lord. And such understanding is beneficial for such a person who easily
understands the transcendental activities of the Lord. In the beginning of this
chapter, the transcendental activities of the Lord were discussed by the Supreme
Lord Himself. One who does not understand the instructions of the Gétä is
faithless, and is to be considered to be misusing the fragmental independence
awarded to him by the Lord. In spite of such instructions, one who does not
understand the real nature of the Lord as the eternal, blissful, all-knowing
Personality of Godhead, is certainly fool number one. Ignorance can be removed
by gradual acceptance of the principles of Kåñëa consciousness. Kåñëa
consciousness is awakened by different types of sacrifices to the demigods,
sacrifice to Brahman, sacrifice in celibacy, in household life, in controlling
the senses, in practicing mystic yoga, in penance, in foregoing material
possessions, in studying the Vedas, and in partaking of the social institution
called varëäçrama-dharma. All of these are known as sacrifice, and all of them
are based on regulated action. But within all these activities, the important
factor is self-realization. One who seeks that objective is the real student of
Bhagavad-gétä, but one who doubts the authority of Kåñëa falls back. One is
therefore advised to study Bhagavad-gétä, or any other scripture, under a bona
fide spiritual master, with service and surrender. A bona fide spiritual master
is in the disciplic succession from time eternal, and he does not deviate at all
from the instructions of the Supreme Lord as they were imparted millions of
years ago to the sun-god, from whom the instructions of Bhagavad-gétä have come
down to the earthly kingdom. One should, therefore, follow the path of
Bhagavad-gétä as it is expressed in the Gétä itself and beware of
self-interested people after personal aggrandizement who deviate others from the
actual path. The Lord is definitely the supreme person, and His activities are
transcendental. One who understands this is a liberated person from the very
beginning of his study of the Gétä.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Fourth Chapter of the
Çrémad-Bhagavad-gétä in the matter of Transcendental Knowledge.



CHAPTER FIVE

Karma-yoga—Action in Kåñëa Consciousness

TEXT 1
arjuna uväca
sannyäsaà karmaëäà kåñëa
punar yogaà ca çaàsasi
yac chreya etayor ekaà
tan me brühi su-niçcitam

arjunaù uväca—Arjuna said; sannyäsam—renunciation; karmaëäm—of all activities;
kåñëa—O Kåñëa; punaù—again; yogam—devotional service; ca—also; çaàsasi—You are
praising; yat—which; çreyaù—is beneficial; etayoù—of these two; ekam—one;
tat—that; me—unto me; brühi—please tell; suniçcitam—definitely.

TRANSLATION
Arjuna said: O Kåñëa, first of all You ask me to renounce work, and then again
You recommend work with devotion. Now will You kindly tell me definitely which
of the two is more beneficial?

PURPORT
In this Fifth Chapter of the Bhagavad-gétä, the Lord says that work in
devotional service is better than dry mental speculation. Devotional service is
easier than the latter because, being transcendental in nature, it frees one
from reaction. In the Second Chapter, preliminary knowledge of the soul and its
entanglement in the material body were explained. How to get out of this
material encagement by buddhi-yoga, or devotional service, was also explained
therein. In the Third Chapter, it was explained that a person who is situated on
the platform of knowledge no longer has any duties to perform. And, in the
Fourth Chapter, the Lord told Arjuna that all kinds of sacrificial work
culminate in knowledge. However, at the end of the Fourth Chapter, the Lord
advised Arjuna to wake up and fight, being situated in perfect knowledge.
Therefore, by simultaneously stressing the importance of both work in devotion
and inaction in knowledge, Kåñëa has perplexed Arjuna and confused his
determination. Arjuna understands that renunciation in knowledge involves
cessation of all kinds of work performed as sense activities. But if one
performs work in devotional service, then how is work stopped? In other words,
he thinks that sannyäsam, or renunciation in knowledge, should be altogether
free from all kinds of activity because work and renunciation appear to him to
be incompatible. He appears not to have understood that work in full knowledge
is nonreactive and is therefore the same as inaction. He inquires, therefore,
whether he should cease work altogether, or work with full knowledge.

çré bhagavän uväca—the Personality of Godhead said; sannyäsaù—renunciation of
work; karma-yogaù—work in devotion; ca—also; niùçreyasa-karau—all leading to the
path of liberation; ubhau—both; tayoù—of the two; tu—but; karma-sannyäsät—in
comparison to the renunciation of fruitive work; karma-yogaù—work in devotion;
viçiñyate—is better.

TRANSLATION
The Blessed Lord said: The renunciation of work and work in devotion are both
good for liberation. But, of the two, work in devotional service is better than
renunciation of works.

PURPORT
Fruitive activities (seeking sense gratification) are cause for material
bondage. As long as one is engaged in activities aimed at improving the standard
of bodily comfort, one is sure to transmigrate to different types of bodies,
thereby continuing material bondage perpetually. Çrémad-Bhägavatam confirms this
as follows:

nünaà pramattaù kurute vikarma yad indriya-prétaya äpåëoti
na sädhu manye yata ätmano ’yam asann api kleçada äsa dehaù

paräbhavas tävad abodha-jäto yävanna jijïäsata ätma-tattvam
yävat kriyäs tävad idaà mano vai karmätmakaà yena çaréra-bandhaù

evaà manaù karma-vaçaà prayuìkte avidyayätmany upadhéyamäne
prétir na yävan mayi väsudeve na mucyate deha-yogena tävat

"People are mad after sense gratification, and they do not know that this
present body, which is full of miseries, is a result of one’s fruitive
activities in the past. Although this body is temporary, it is always giving one
trouble in many ways. Therefore, to act for sense gratification is not good. One
is considered to be a failure in life as long as he makes no inquiry about the
nature of work for fruitive results, for as long as one is engrossed in the
consciousness of sense gratification, one has to transmigrate from one body to
another. Although the mind may be engrossed in fruitive activities and
influenced by ignorance, one must develop a love for devotional service to
Väsudeva. Only then can one have the opportunity to get out of the bondage of
material existence." (Bhäg. 5.5.4-6)

Therefore, jïäna (or knowledge that one is not this material body but spirit
soul) is not sufficient for liberation. One has to act in the status of spirit
soul, otherwise there is no escape from material bondage. Action in Kåñëa
consciousness is not, however, action on the fruitive platform. Activities
performed in full knowledge strengthen one’s advancement in real knowledge.
Without Kåñëa consciousness, mere renunciation of fruitive activities does not
actually purify the heart of a conditioned soul. As long as the heart is not
purified, one has to work on the fruitive platform. But action in Kåñëa
consciousness automatically helps one escape the result of fruitive action so
that one need not descend to the material platform. Therefore, action in Kåñëa
consciousness is always superior to renunciation, which always entails a risk of
falling. Renunciation without Kåñëa consciousness is incomplete, as is confirmed
by Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé in his Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu.

präpaïcikatayä buddhyä hari-sambandhi-vastunaù
mumukñubhiù parityägo vairägyaà phalgu kathyate.

"Renunciation by persons eager to achieve liberation of things which are related
to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, though they are material, is called
incomplete renunciation." Renunciation is compete when it is in the knowledge
that everything in existence belongs to the Lord and that no one should claim
proprietorship over anything. One should understand that, factually, nothing
belongs to anyone. Then where is the question of renunciation? One who knows
that everything is Kåñëa’s property is always situated in renunciation. Since
everything belongs to Kåñëa, everything should be employed in the service of
Kåñëa. This perfect form of action in Kåñëa consciousness is far better than any
amount of artificial renunciation by a sannyäsé of the Mäyävädé school.

TRANSLATION
One who neither hates nor desires the fruits of his activities is known to be
always renounced. Such a person, liberated from all dualities, easily overcomes
material bondage and is completely liberated, O mighty-armed Arjuna.

PURPORT
One who is fully in Kåñëa consciousness is always a renouncer because he feels
neither hatred nor desire for the results of his actions. Such a renouncer,
dedicated to the transcendental loving service of the Lord, is fully qualified
in knowledge because he knows his constitutional position in his relationship
with Kåñëa. He knows fully well that Kåñëa is the whole and that he is part and
parcel of Kåñëa. Such knowledge is perfect because it is qualitatively and
quantitatively correct. The concept of oneness with Kåñëa is incorrect because
the part cannot be equal to the whole. Knowledge that one is one in quality yet
different in quantity is correct transcendental knowledge leading one to become
full in himself, having nothing to aspire to nor lament over. There is no
duality in his mind because whatever he does, he does for Kåñëa. Being thus
freed from the platform of dualities, he is liberated—even in this material
world.

service; påthak—different; bäläù—less intelligent; pravadanti—do talk; na—never;
paëòitäù—the learned; ekam—in one; api—even though; ästhitaù—being situated;

TRANSLATION
Only the ignorant speak of karma-yoga and devotional service as being different
from the analytical study of the material world [säìkhya]. Those who are
actually learned say that he who applies himself well to one of these paths
achieves the results of both.

PURPORT
The aim of the analytical study of the material world is to find the soul of
existence. The soul of the material world is Viñëu, or the Supersoul. Devotional
service to the Lord entails service to the Supersoul. One process is to find the
root of the tree, and next to water the root. The real student of säìkhya
philosophy finds the root of the material world, Viñëu, and then, in perfect
knowledge, engages himself in the service of the Lord. Therefore, in essence,
there is no difference between the two because the aim of both is Viñëu. Those
who do not know the ultimate end say that the purposes of säìkhya and karma-yoga
are not the same, but one who is learned knows the unifying aim in these
different processes.


TEXT 5

yat—what; säìkhyaiù—by means of säìkhya philosophy; präpyate—is achieved;
sthänam—place; tat—that; yogaiù—by devotional service; api—also; gamyate—one can
attain; ekam—one; säìkhyam—analytical study; ca—and; yogam—action in devotion;
ca—and; yaù—one who; paçyati—sees; saù—he; paçyati—actually sees.

TRANSLATION
One who knows that the position reached by means of renunciation can also be
attained by works in devotional service and who therefore sees that the path of
works and the path of renunciation are one, sees things as they are.

PURPORT
The real purpose of philosophical research is to find the ultimate goal of life.
Since the ultimate goal of life is self-realization, there is no difference
between the conclusions reached by the two processes. By säìkhya philosophical
research one comes to the conclusion that a living entity is not a part and
parcel of the material world, but of the supreme spirit whole. Consequently, the
spirit soul has nothing to do with the material world; his actions must be in
some relation with the Supreme. When he acts in Kåñëa consciousness, he is
actually in his constitutional position. In the first process of säìkhya, one
has to become detached from matter, and in the devotional yoga process one has
to attach himself to the work of Kåñëa. Factually, both processes are the same,
although superficially one process appears to involve detachment and the other
process appears to involve attachment. However, detachment from matter and
attachment to Kåñëa are one and the same. One who can see this sees things as
they are.

service; yoga-yuktaù—one engaged in devotional service; muniù—thinker;

TRANSLATION
Unless one is engaged in the devotional service of the Lord, mere renunciation
of activities cannot make one happy. The sages, purified by works of devotion,
achieve the Supreme without delay.

PURPORT
There are two classes of sannyäsés, or persons in the renounced order of life.
The Mäyävädé sannyäsés are engaged in the study of säìkhya philosophy, whereas
the Vaisnava sannyäsés are engaged in the study of Bhägavatam philosophy, which
affords the proper commentary on the Vedänta-sütras. The Mäyävädé sannyäsés also
study the Vedänta-sütras, but use their own commentary, called Çäréraka-bhäñya,
written by Çaìkaräcärya. The students of the Bhägavata school are engaged in
devotional service of the Lord, according to päïcarätriké regulations, and
therefore the Vaiñëava sannyäsés have multiple engagements in the transcendental
service of the Lord. The Vaiñëava sannyäsés have nothing to do with material
activities, and yet they perform various activities in their devotional service
to the Lord. But the Mäyävädé sannyäsés, engaged in the studies of säìkhya and
Vedänta and speculation, cannot relish transcendental service of the Lord.
Because their studies become very tedious, they sometimes become tired of
Brahman speculation, and thus they take shelter of the Bhägavatam without proper
understanding. Consequently their study of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam becomes
troublesome. Dry speculations and impersonal interpretations by artificial means
are all useless for the Mäyävädé sannyäsés. The Vaiñëava sannyäsés, who are
engaged in devotional service, are happy in the discharge of their
transcendental duties, and they have the guarantee of ultimate entrance into the
kingdom of God. The Mäyävädé sannyäsés sometimes fall down from the path of
self-realization and again enter into material activities of a philanthropic and
altruistic nature, which are nothing but material engagements. Therefore, the
conclusion is that those who are engaged in Kåñëa consciousness are better
situated than the sannyäsés engaged in simple Brahman speculation, although they
too come to Kåñëa consciousness, after many births.

TRANSLATION
One who works in devotion, who is a pure soul, and who controls his mind and
senses, is dear to everyone, and everyone is dear to him. Though always working,
such a man is never entangled.

PURPORT
One who is on the path of liberation by Kåñëa consciousness is very dear to
every living being, and every living being is dear to him. This is due to his
Kåñëa consciousness. Such a person cannot think of any living being as separate
from Kåñëa, just as the leaves and branches of a tree are not separate from the
tree. He knows very well that by pouring water on the root of the tree, the
water will be distributed to all the leaves and branches, or by supplying food
to the stomach, the energy is automatically distributed throughout the body.
Because one who works in Kåñëa consciousness is servant to all, he is very dear
to everyone. And, because everyone is satisfied by his work, he is pure in
consciousness. Because he is pure in consciousness, his mind is completely
controlled. And, because his mind is controlled, his senses are also controlled.
Because his mind is always fixed on Kåñëa, there is no chance of his being
deviated from Kåñëa. Nor is there a chance that he will engage his senses in
matters other than the service of the Lord. He does not like to hear anything
except topics relating to Kåñëa; he does not like to eat anything which is not
offered to Kåñëa; and he does not wish to go anywhere if Kåñëa is not involved.
Therefore, his senses are controlled. A man of controlled senses cannot be
offensive to anyone. One may ask, "Why then was Arjuna offensive (in battle) to
others? Wasn't he in Kåñëa consciousness?" Arjuna was only superficially
offensive because (as has already been explained in the Second Chapter) all the
assembled persons on the battlefield would continue to live individually, as the
soul cannot be slain. So, spiritually, no one was killed on the Battlefield of
Kurukñetra. Only their dresses were changed by the order of Kåñëa, who was
personally present. Therefore Arjuna, while fighting on the Battlefield of
Kurukñetra, was not really fighting at all; he was simply carrying out the
orders of Kåñëa in full Kåñëa consciousness. Such a person is never entangled in
the reactions of work.

TRANSLATION
A person in the divine consciousness, although engaged in seeing, hearing,
touching, smelling, eating, moving about, sleeping, and breathing, always knows
within himself that he actually does nothing at all. Because while speaking,
evacuating, receiving, opening or closing his eyes, he always knows that only
the material senses are engaged with their objects and that he is aloof from
them.

PURPORT
A person in Kåñëa consciousness is pure in his existence, and consequently he
has nothing to do with any work which depends upon five immediate and remote
causes: the doer, the work, the situation, the endeavor and fortune. This is
because he is engaged in the loving transcendental service of Kåñëa. Although he
appears to be acting with his body and senses, he is always conscious of his
actual position, which is spiritual engagement. In material consciousness, the
senses are engaged in sense gratification, but in Kåñëa consciousness the senses
are engaged in the satisfaction of Kåñëa’s senses. Therefore, the Kåñëa
conscious person is always free, even though he appears to be engaged in things
of the senses. Activities such as seeing, hearing, speaking, evacuating, etc.,
are actions of the senses meant for work. A Kåñëa consciousness person is never
affected by the actions of the senses. He cannot perform any act except in the
service of the Lord because he knows that he is the eternal servitor of the
Lord.

annaà ca jäyate, and, in the Bhagavad-gétä, mama yonir mahad brahma, indicate
that everything in the material world is the manifestation of Brahman; and,
although the effects are differently manifested, they are nondifferent from the
cause. In the Éçopaniñad it is said that everything is related to the Supreme
Brahman or Kåñëa, and thus everything belongs to Him only. One who knows
perfectly well that everything belongs to Kåñëa, that He is the proprietor of
everything and that, therefore, everything is engaged in the service of the
Lord, naturally has nothing to do with the results of his activities, whether
virtuous or sinful. Even one’s material body, being a gift of the Lord for
carrying out a particular type of action, can be engaged in Kåñëa consciousness.
It is beyond contamination by sinful reactions, exactly as the lotus leaf,
though remaining in the water, is not wet. The Lord also says in the Gétä: mayi
sarväëi karmäëi sannyasya: "Resign all works unto Me [Kåñëa]." The conclusion is
that a person without Kåñëa consciousness acts according to the concept of the
material body and senses, but a person in Kåñëa consciousness acts according to
the knowledge that the body is the property of Kåñëa and should therefore be
engaged in the service of Kåñëa.

TRANSLATION
The yogés, abandoning attachment, act with body, mind, intelligence, and even
with the senses, only for the purpose of purification.

PURPORT
By acting in Kåñëa consciousness for the satisfaction of the senses of Kåñëa,
any action, whether of the body, mind, intelligence or even of the senses, is
purified of material contamination. There are no material reactions resulting
from the activities of a Kåñëa conscious person. Therefore, purified activities,
which are generally called sadäcära, can be easily performed by acting in Kåñëa
consciousness. Çré Rüpa Gosvämé in his Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu describes this as
follows:

éhä yasya harer däsye karmaëä manasä girä
nikhiläsv apy avasthäsu jévanmuktaù sa ucyate

A person acting in Kåñëa consciousness (or, in other words, in the service of
Kåñëa) with his body, mind, intelligence and words is a liberated person even
within the material world, although he may be engaged in many so-called material
activities. He has no false ego, nor does he believe that he is this material
body, nor that he possesses the body. He knows that he is not this body and that
this body does not belong to him. He himself belongs to Kåñëa, and the body too
belongs to Kåñëa. When he applies everything produced of the body, mind,
intelligence, words, life, wealth, etc.—whatever he may have within his
possession—to Kåñëa’s service, he is at once dovetailed with Kåñëa. He is one
with Kåñëa and is devoid of the false ego that leads one to believe that he is
the body, etc. This is the perfect stage of Kåñëa consciousness.

yuktaù—one who is engaged in devotional service; karma-phalam—the results of all
activities; tyaktvä—giving up; çäntim—perfect peace; äpnoti—achieves;
naiñöhikém—unflinching; ayuktaù—one who is not in Kåñëa consciousness;
käma-käreëa—for enjoying the result of work; phale—in the result;
saktaù—attached; nibadhyate—becomes entangled.

TRANSLATION
The steadily devoted soul attains unadulterated peace because he offers the
result of all activities to Me; whereas a person who is not in union with the
Divine, who is greedy for the fruits of his labor, becomes entangled.

PURPORT
The difference between a person in Kåñëa consciousness and a person in bodily
consciousness is that the former is attached to Kåñëa, whereas the latter is
attached to the results of his activities. The person who is attached to Kåñëa
and works for Him only is certainly a liberated person, and he is not anxious
for fruitive rewards. In the Bhägavatam, the cause of anxiety over the result of
an activity is explained as being due to one’s functioning in the conception of
duality, that is, without knowledge of the Absolute Truth. Kåñëa is the Supreme
Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead. In Kåñëa consciousness, there is no
duality. All that exists is a product of Kåñëa’s energy, and Kåñëa is all good.
Therefore, activities in Kåñëa consciousness are on the absolute plane; they are
transcendental and have no material effect. One is, therefore, filled with peace
in Kåñëa consciousness. One who is, however, entangled in profit calculation for
sense gratification cannot have that peace. This is the secret of Kåñëa
consciousness—realization that there is no existence besides Kåñëa is the
platform of peace and fearlessness.

TRANSLATION
When the embodied living being controls his nature and mentally renounces all
actions, he resides happily in the city of nine gates [the material body],
neither working nor causing work to be done.

PURPORT
The embodied soul lives in the city of nine gates. The activities of the body,
or the figurative city of body, are conducted automatically by the particular
modes of nature. The soul, although subjecting himself to the conditions of the
body, can be beyond those conditions, if he so desires. Owing only to
forgetfulness of his superior nature, he identifies with the material body, and
therefore suffers. By Kåñëa consciousness, he can revive his real position and
thus come out of his embodiment. Therefore, when one takes to Kåñëa
consciousness, one at once becomes completely aloof from bodily activities. In
such a controlled life, in which his deliberations are changed, he lives happily
within the city of nine gates. The nine gates are described as follows:

nava-dväre pure dehé haàso leläyate bahiù
vaçé sarvasya lokasya sthävarasya carasya ca.

"The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is living within the body of a living
entity, is the controller of all living entities all over the universe. The body
consists of nine gates: two eyes, two nostrils, two ears, one mouth, the anus
and the genital. The living entity in his conditioned stage identifies himself
with the body, but when he identifies himself with the Lord within himself, he
becomes just as free as the Lord, even while in the body." (Çvet. 3.18)

Therefore, a Kåñëa conscious person is free from both the outer and inner
activities of the material body.

TRANSLATION
The embodied spirit, master of the city of his body, does not create activities,
nor does he induce people to act, nor does he create the fruits of action. All
this is enacted by the modes of material nature.

PURPORT
The living entity, as will be explained in the Seventh Chapter, is one in nature
with the Supreme Lord, distinguished from matter, which is another nature—called
inferior—of the Lord. Somehow, the superior nature, the living entity, has been
in contact with material nature since time immemorial. The temporary body or
material dwelling place which he obtains is the cause of varieties of activities
and their resultant reactions. Living in such a conditional atmosphere, one
suffers the results of the activities of the body by identifying himself (in
ignorance) with the body. It is ignorance acquired from time immemorial that is
the cause of bodily suffering and distress. As soon as the living entity becomes
aloof from the activities of the body, he becomes free from the reactions as
well. As long as he is in the city of body, he appears to be the master of it,
but actually he is neither its proprietor nor controller of its actions and
reactions. He is simply in the midst of the material ocean, struggling for
existence. The waves of the ocean are tossing him, and he has no control over
them. His best solution is to get out of the water by transcendental Kåñëa
consciousness. That alone will save him from all turmoil.

TRANSLATION
Nor does the Supreme Spirit assume anyone’s sinful or pious activities. Embodied
beings, however, are bewildered because of the ignorance which covers their real
knowledge.

PURPORT
The Sanskrit word vibhuù means the Supreme Lord who is full of unlimited
knowledge, riches, strength, fame, beauty and renunciation. He is always
satisfied in Himself, undisturbed by sinful or pious activities. He does not
create a particular situation for any living entity, but the living entity,
bewildered by ignorance, desires to be put into certain conditions of life, and
thereby his chain of action and reaction begins. A living entity is, by superior
nature, full of knowledge. Nevertheless, he is prone to be influenced by
ignorance due to his limited power. The Lord is omnipotent, but the living
entity is not. The Lord is vibhu, or omniscient, but the living entity is aëu,
or atomic. Because he is a living soul, he has the capacity to desire by his
free will. Such desire is fulfilled only by the omnipotent Lord. And so, when
the living entity is bewildered in his desires, the Lord allows him to fulfill
those desires, but the Lord is never responsible for the actions and reactions
of the particular situation which may be desired. Being in a bewildered
condition, therefore, the embodied soul identifies himself with the
circumstantial material body and becomes subjected to the temporary misery and
happiness of life. The Lord is the constant companion of the living entity as
Paramätmä, or the Supersoul, and therefore He can understand the desires of the
individual soul, as one can smell the flavor of a flower by being near it.
Desire is a subtle form of conditioning of the living entity. The Lord fulfills
his desire as he deserves: Man proposes and God disposes. The individual is not,
therefore, omnipotent in fulfilling his desires. The Lord, however, can fulfill
all desires, and the Lord, being neutral to everyone, does not interfere with
the desires of the minute independant living entities. However, when one desires
Kåñëa, the Lord takes special care and encourages one to desire in such a way
that one can attain to Him and be eternally happy. The Vedic hymn therefore
declares:

eña u hy eva sädhu karma kärayati taà yamebhyo lokebhya unninéñate
eña u eväsädhu karma kärayati yamadho ninéñate.

ajïo jantur anéso ’yam ätmanaù sukha-duùkhayoù
éçvara-prerito gacchet svargaà väçvabhram eva ca.

"The Lord engages the living entity in pious activities so he may be elevated.
The Lord engages him in impious activities so he may go to hell. The living
entity is completely dependant in his distress and happiness. By the will of the
Supreme he can go to heaven or hell, as a cloud is driven by the air."

Therefore the embodied soul, by his immemorial desire to avoid Kåñëa
consciousness, causes his own bewilderment. Consequently, although he is
constitutionally eternal, blissful and cognizant, due to the littleness of his
existence he forgets his constitutional position of service to the Lord and is
thus entrapped by nescience. And, under the spell of ignorance, the living
entity claims that the Lord is responsible for his conditional existence. The
Vedänta-sütras also confirm this:

vaiñamya-nairghåëye na säpekñatvät tathä hi darçayati.

"The Lord neither hates nor likes anyone, though He appears to."

TRANSLATION
When, however, one is enlightened with the knowledge by which nescience is
destroyed, then his knowledge reveals everything, as the sun lights up
everything in the daytime.

PURPORT
Those who have forgotten Kåñëa must certainly be bewildered, but those who are
in Kåñëa consciousness are not bewildered at all. It is stated in the
Bhagavad-gétä, "sarvaà jïäna-plavena," "jïänägniù sarva-karmäëi" and "na hi
jïänena sadåçam." Knowledge is always highly esteemed. And what is that
knowledge? Perfect knowledge is achieved when one surrenders unto Kåñëa, as is
said in the Seventh Chapter, 19th verse: bahünäà janmanäm ante jïänavän mäà
prapadyate. After passing through many, many births, when one perfect in
knowledge surrenders unto Kåñëa, or when one attains Kåñëa consciousness, then
everything is revealed to him, as the sun reveals everything in the daytime. The
living entity is bewildered in so many ways. For instance, when he thinks
himself God, unceremoniously, he actually falls into the last snare of
nescience. If a living entity is God, then how can he become bewildered by
nescience? Does God become bewildered by nescience? If so, then nescience, or
Satan, is greater than God. Real knowledge can be obtained from a person who is
in perfect Kåñëa consciousness. Therefore, one has to seek out such a bona fide
spiritual master and, under him, learn what Kåñëa consciousness is. The
spiritual master can drive away all nescience, as the sun drives away darkness.
Even though a person may be in full knowledge that he is not this body but is
transcendental to the body, he still may not be able to discriminate between the
soul and the Supersoul. However, he can know everything well if he cares to take
shelter of the perfect, bona fide Kåñëa conscious spiritual master. One can know
God and one’s relationship with God only when one actually meets a
representative of God. A representative of God never claims that he is God,
although he is paid all the respect ordinarily paid to God because he has
knowledge of God. One has to learn the distinction between God and the living
entity. Lord Çré Kåñëa therefore stated in the Second Chapter (2.12) that every
living being is individual and that the Lord also is individual. They were all
individuals in the past, they are individuals at present, and they will continue
to be individuals in the future, even after liberation. At night we see
everything as one in the darkness, but in day when the sun is up, we see
everything in its real identity. Identity with individuality in spiritual life
is real knowledge.

TRANSLATION
When one’s intelligence, mind, faith and refuge are all fixed in the Supreme,
then one becomes fully cleansed of misgivings through complete knowledge and
thus proceeds straight on the path of liberation.

PURPORT
The Supreme Transcendental Truth is Lord Kåñëa. The whole Bhagavad-gétä centers
around the declaration of Kåñëa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is
the version of all Vedic literature. Paratattva means the Supreme Reality, who
is understood by the knowers of the Supreme as Brahman, Paramätmä and Bhagavän.
Bhagavän, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the last word in the
Absolute. There is nothing more than that.TheLord says, mattaù parataraà nänyat
kiïcit asti dhanaïjaya. Impersonal Brahman is also supported by Kåñëa: brahmaëo
pratiñöhäham. Therefore in all ways Kåñëa is the Supreme Reality. One whose
mind, intelligence, faith and refuge are always in Kåñëa, or, in other words,
one who is fully in Kåñëa consciousness, is undoubtedly washed clean of all
misgivings and is in perfect knowledge in everything concerning transcendence. A
Kåñëa conscious person can thoroughly understand that there is duality
(simultaneous identity and individuality) in Kåñëa, and, equipped with such
transcendental knowledge, one can make steady progress on the path of
liberation.

TRANSLATION
The humble sage, by virtue of true knowledge, sees with equal vision a learned
and gentle brähmaëa, a cow, an elephant, a dog and a dog-eater [outcaste] .

PURPORT
A Kåñëa conscious person does not make any distinction between species or
castes. The brähmaëa and the outcaste may be different from the social point of
view, or a dog, a cow, or an elephant may be different from the point of view of
species, but these differences of body are meaningless from the viewpoint of a
learned transcendentalist. This is due to their relationship to the Supreme, for
the Supreme Lord, by His plenary portion as Paramätmä, is present in everyone’s
heart. Such an understanding of the Supreme is real knowledge. As far as the
bodies are concerned in different castes or different species of life, the Lord
is equally kind to everyone because He treats every living being as a friend yet
maintains Himself as Paramätmä regardless of the circumstances of the living
entities. The Lord as Paramätmä is present both in the outcaste and in the
brähmaëa, although the body of a brähmaëa and that of an outcaste are not the
same. The bodies are material productions of different modes of material nature,
but the soul and the Supersoul within the body are of the same spiritual
quality. The similarity in the quality of the soul and the Supersoul, however,
does not make them equal in quantity, for the individual soul is present only in
that particular body, whereas the Paramätmä is present in each and every body. A
Kåñëa conscious person has full knowledge of this, and therefore he is truly
learned and has equal vision. The similar characteristics of the soul and
Supersoul are that they are both conscious, eternal and blissful. But the
difference is that the individual soul is conscious within the limited
jurisdiction of the body, whereas the Supersoul is conscious of all bodies. The
Supersoul is present in all bodies without distinction.

TRANSLATION
Those whose minds are established in sameness and equanimity have already
conquered the conditions of birth and death. They are flawless like Brahman, and
thus they are already situated in Brahman.

PURPORT
Equanimity of mind, as mentioned above, is the sign of self-realization. Those
who have actually attained to such a stage should be considered to have
conquered material conditions, specifically birth and death. As long as one
identifies with this body, he is considered a conditioned soul, but as soon as
he is elevated to the stage of equanimity through realization of self, he is
liberated from conditional life. In other words, he is no longer subject to take
birth in the material world but can enter into the spiritual sky after his
death. The Lord is flawless because He is without attraction or hatred.
Similarly, when a living entity is without attraction or hatred, he also becomes
flawless and eligible to enter into the spiritual sky. Such persons are to be
considered already liberated, and their symptoms are described below.

TRANSLATION
A person who neither rejoices upon achieving something pleasant nor laments upon
obtaining something unpleasant, who is self-intelligent, unbewildered, and who
knows the science of God, is to be understood as already situated in
Transcendence.

PURPORT
The symptoms of the self-realized person are given herein. The first symptom is
that he is not illusioned by the false identification of the body with his true
self. He knows perfectly well that he is not this body, but is the fragmental
port~on of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is therefore not joyful in
achieving something, nor does he lament in losing anything which is related to
his body. This steadiness of mind is called sthira-buddhi, or self-intelligence.
He is therefore never bewildered by mistaking the gross body for the soul, nor
does he accept the body as permanent and disregard the existence of the soul.
This knowledge elevates him to the station of knowing the complete science of
the Absolute Truth, namely Brahman, Paramätmä and Bhagavän. He thus knows his
constitutional position perfectly well, without falsely trying to become one
with the Supreme in all respects. This is called Brahman realization, or
self-realization. Such steady consciousness is called Kåñëa consciousness.

TRANSLATION
Such a liberated person is not attracted to material sense pleasure or external
objects but is always in trance, enjoying the pleasure within. In this way the
self-realized person enjoys unlimited happiness, for he concentrates on the
Supreme.

PURPORT
Çré Yämunäcärya, a great devotee in Kåñëa consciousness, said:

"Since I have been engaged in the transcendental loving service of Kåñëa,
realizing ever-new pleasure in Him, whenever I think of sex pleasure, I spit at
the thought, and my lips curl with distaste." A person in brahma-yoga, or Kåñëa
consciousness, is so absorbed in the loving service of the Lord that he loses
his taste for material sense pleasure altogether. The highest pleasure in terms
of matter is sex pleasure. The whole world is moving under its spell, and a
materialist cannot work at all without this motivation. But a person engaged in
Kåñëa consciousness can work with greater vigor without sex pleasure, which he
avoids. That is the test in spiritual realization. Spiritual realization and sex
pleasure go ill together. A Kåñëa conscious person is not attracted to any kind
of sense pleasure due to his being a liberated soul.

TRANSLATION
An intelligent person does not take part in the sources of misery, which are due
to contact with the material senses. O son of Kunté, such pleasures have a
beginning and an end, and so the wise man does not delight in them.

PURPORT
Material sense pleasures are due to the contact of the material senses, which
are all temporary because the body itself is temporary. A liberated soul is not
interested in anything which is temporary. Knowing well the joys of
transcendental pleasures, how can a liberated soul agree to enjoy false
pleasure? In the Padma Puräëa it is said:

ramante yogino ’nante satyänanda-cid-ätmani
iti räma-padenäsau paraà brahmäbhidhéyate

"The mystics derive unlimited transcendental pleasures from the Absolute Truth,
and therefore the Supreme Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead, is also
known as Räma."

In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam also it is said:

näyaà deho deha-bhäjäà nå-loke
kañöän kämän arhate viò-bhajäà ye
tapo divyaà putrakä yena sattvaà
çuddhyed yasmäd brahma-saukhyaà tv anantam.

"My dear sons, there is no reason to labor very hard for sense pleasure while in
this human form of life; such pleasures are available to the stool-eaters
[hogs]. Rather, you should undergo penances in this life by which your existence
will be purified, and, as a result, you will be able to enjoy unlimited
transcendental bliss." (Bhäg. 5.5.1)

Therefore, those who are true yogés or learned transcendentalists are not
attracted by sense pleasures, which are the causes of continuous material
existence. The more one is addicted to material pleasures, the more he is
entrapped by material miseries.

TRANSLATION
Before giving up this present body, if one is able to tolerate the urges of the
material senses and check the force of desire and anger, he is a yogé and is
happy in this world.

PURPORT
lf one wants to make steady progress on the path of self-realization, he must
try to control the forces of the material senses. There are the forces of talk,
forces of anger, forces of mind, forces of the stomach, forces of the genitals,
and forces of the tongue. One who is able to control the forces of all these
different senses, and the mind, is called gosvämé, or svämé. Such gosvämés live
strictly controlled lives, and forego altogether the forces of the senses.
Material desires, when unsatiated, generate anger, and thus the mind, eyes and
chest become agitated. Therefore, one must practice to control them before one
gives up this material body. One who can do this is understood to be
self-realized and is thus happy in the state of self-realization. It is the duty
of the transcendentalist to try strenuously to control desire and anger.

TRANSLATION
One whose happiness is within, who is active within, who rejoices within and is
illumined within, is actually the perfect mystic. He is liberated in the
Supreme, and ultimately he attains the Supreme.

PURPORT
Unless one is able to relish happiness from within, how can one retire from the
external engagements meant for deriving superficial happiness? A liberated
person enjoys happiness by factual experience. He can, therefore, sit silently
at any place and enjoy the activities of life from within. Such a liberated
person no longer desires external material happiness. This state is called
brahma-bhüta, attaining which one is assured of going back to Godhead, back to
home.

TRANSLATION
One who is beyond duality and doubt, whose mind is engaged within, who is always
busy working for the welfare of all sentient beings, and who is free from all
sins, achieves liberation in the Supreme.

PURPORT
Only a person who is fully in Kåñëa consciousness can be said to be engaged in
welfare work for all living entities. When a person is actually in the knowledge
that Kåñëa is the fountainhead of everything, then when he acts in that spirit
he acts for everyone. The sufferings of humanity are due to forgetfulness of
Kåñëa as the supreme enjoyer, the supreme proprietor, and the supreme friend.
Therefore, to act to revive this consciousness within the entire human society
is the highest welfare work. One cannot be engaged in first-class welfare work
without being liberated in the Supreme. A Kåñëa conscious person has no doubt
about the supremacy of Kåñëa. He has no doubt because he is completely freed
from all sins. This is the state of divine love.

A person engaged only in ministering to the physical welfare of human society
cannot factually help anyone. Temporary relief of the external body and the mind
is not satisfactory. The real cause of one’s difficulties in the hard struggle
for life may be found in one’s forgetfulness of his relationship with the
Supreme Lord. When a man is fully conscious of his relationship with Kåñëa, he
is actually a liberated soul, although he may be in the material tabernacle.

TRANSLATION
Those who are free from anger and all material desires, who are selfrealized,
self-disciplined and constantly endeavoring for perfection, are assured of
liberation in the Supreme in the very near future.

PURPORT
Of the saintly persons who are constantly engaged in striving toward salvation,
one who is in Kåñëa consciousness is the best of all. The Bhägavatam confirms
this fact as follows:

yat-päda-paìkaja-paläça-viläsa-bhaktyä
karmäçayaà grathitam udgrathayanti santaù
tadvan na rikta-matayo yatayo ’pi ruddha-
srotogaëäs tam araëaà bhaja väsudevam.

"Just try to worship, in devotional service, Väsudeva, the Supreme Personality
of Godhead. Even great sages are not able to control the forces of the senses as
effectively as those who are engaged in transcendental bliss by serving the
lotus feet of the Lord, uprooting the deep grown desire for fruitive
activities." (Bhäg. 4.22.39)

In the conditioned soul the desire to enjoy the fruitive results of work is so
deep-rooted that it is very difficult even for the great sages to control such
desires, despite great endeavors. A devotee of the Lord, constantly engaged in
devotional service in Kåñëa consciousness, perfect in self-realization, very
quickly attains liberation in the Supreme. Owing to his complete knowledge in
self-realization, he always remains in trance. To cite an analagous example of
this:

darçana-dhyäna-saàsparçair matsya-kürma-vihaìgamäù
svänya patyäni puñëanti tathäham api padmaja.

"By vision, by meditation and by touch only do the fish, the tortoise and the
birds maintain their offspring. Similarly do I also, O Padmaja!"

The fish brings up its offspring simply by looking at them. The tortoise brings
up its offspring simply by meditation. The eggs of the tortoise are laid on
land, and the tortoise meditates on the eggs while in the water. Similarly, a
devotee in Kåñëa consciousness, although far away from the Lord’s abode, can
elevate himself to that abode simply by thinking of Him constantly—by engagement
in Kåñëa consciousness. He does not feel the pangs of material miseries; this
state of life is called brahma-nirväëa, or the absence of material miseries due
to being constantly immersed in the Supreme.

TRANSLATION
Shutting out all external sense objects, keeping the eyes and vision
concentrated between the two eyebrows, suspending the inward and outward breaths
within the nostrils—thus controlling the mind, senses and intelligence, the
tranecendentalist becomes free from desire, fear and anger. One who is always in
this state is certainly liberated.

PURPORT
Being engaged in Kåñëa consciousness, one can immediately understand one’s
spiritual identity, and then one can understand the Supreme Lord by means of
devotional service. When he is well situated in devotional service, one comes to
the transcendental position, qualified to feel the presence of the Lord in the
sphere of one’s activity. This particular position is called liberation in the
Supreme.

After explaining the above principles of liberation in the Supreme, the Lord
gives instruction to Arjuna as to how one can come to that position by the
practice of mysticism or yoga, known as añöäìga-yoga, which is divisible into an
eightfold procedure called yama, niyama, äsana, präëäyäma, pratyähära, dhäraëä,
dhyäna, and samädhi. In the Sixth Chapter the subject of yoga is explicitly
detailed, and at the end of the Fifth it is only preliminarily explained. One
has to drive out the sense objects such as sound, touch, form, taste and smell
by the pratyähära (breathing) process in yoga, and then keep the vision of the
eyes between the two eyebrows and concentrate on the tip of the nose with half
closed lids. There is no benefit in closing the eyes altogether, because then
there is every chance of falling asleep. Nor is there benefit in opening the
eyes completely, because then there is the hazard of being attracted by sense
objects. The breathing movement is restrained within the nostrils by
neutralizing the up- and down-moving air within the body. By practice of such
yoga one is able to gain control over the senses, refrain from outward sense
objects, and thus prepare oneself for liberation in the Supreme.

This yoga process helps one become free from all kinds of fear and anger and
thus feel the presence of the Supersoul in the transcendental situation. In
other words, Kåñëa consciousness is the easiest process of executing yoga
principles. This will be thoroughly explained in the next chapter. A Kåñëa
conscious person, however, being always engaged in devotional service, does not
risk losing his senses to some other engagement. This is a better way of
controlling the senses than by the añöäìga-yoga.

TRANSLATION
The sages, knowing Me as the ultimate purpose of all sacrifices and austerities,
the Supreme Lord of all planets and demigods and the benefactor and well-wisher
of all living entities, attain peace from the pangs of material miseries.

PURPORT
The conditioned souls within the clutches of illusory energy are all anxious to
attain peace in the material world. But they do not know the formula for peace,
which is explained in this part of the Bhagavad-gétä. The greatest peace formula
is simply this: Lord Kåñëa is the beneficiary in all human activities. Men
should offer everything to the transcendental service of the Lord because He is
the proprietor of all planets and the demigods thereon. No one is greater than
He. He is greater than the greatest of the demigods, Lord Çiva and Lord Brahmä.
In the Vedas the Supreme Lord is described as tam éçvaräëäà paramaà maheçvaram.
Under the spell of illusion, living entities are trying to be lords of all they
survey, but actually they are dominated by the material energy of the Lord. The
Lord is the master of material nature, and the conditioned souls are under the
stringent rules of material nature. Unless one understands these bare facts, it
is not possible to achieve peace in the world either individually or
collectively. This is the sense of Kssna consciousness: Lord Kåñëa is the
supreme predominator, and all living entities, including the great demigods, are
His subordinates. One can attain perfect peace only in complete Kåñëa
consciousness.

This Fifth Chapter is a practical explanation of Kåñëa consciousness, generally
known as karma-yoga. The question of mental speculation as to how karma-yoga can
give liberation is answered herewith. To work in Kåñëa consciousness is to work
with the complete knowledge of the Lord as the predominator. Such work is not
different from transcendental knowledge. Direct Kåñëa consciousness is
bhakti-yoga, and jïäna-yoga is a path leading to bhakti-yoga. Kåñëa
consciousness means to work in full knowledge of one’s relationship with the
Supreme Absolute, and the perfection of this consciousness is full knowledge of
Kåñëa, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A pure soul is the eternal servant
of God as His fragmental part and parcel. He comes into contact with mäyä
(illusion) due to the desire to lord it over mäyä, and that is the cause of his
many sufferings. As long as he is in contact with matter, he has to execute work
in terms of material necessities. Kåñëa consciousness, however, brings one into
spiritual life even while one is within the jurisdiction of matter, for it is an
arousing of spiritual existence by practice in the material world. The more one
is advanced, the more he is freed from the clutches of matter. The Lord is not
partial toward anyone. Everything depends on one’s practical performance of
duties in an effort to control the senses and conquer the influence of desire
and anger. And, attaining Kåñëa consciousness by controlling the above-mentioned
passions, one remains factually in the transcendental stage, or brahman-nirväëa.
The eightfold yoga mysticism is automatically practiced in Kåñëa consciousness
because the ultimate purpose is served. There is gradual process of elevation in
the practice of yama, niyama, äsana, pratyähära, dhyäna, dhäraëä, präëäyäma, and
samädhi. But these only preface perfection by devotional service, which alone
can award peace to the human being. It is the highest perfection of life.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Fifth Chapter of the
Çrémad-Bhagavad-gétä in the matter of Karma-yoga, or Action in Kåñëa
Consciousness.

TRANSLATION
The Blessed Lord said: One who is unattached to the fruits of his work and who
works as he is obligated is in the renounced order of life, and he is the true
mystic: not he who lights no fire and performs no work.

PURPORT
In this chapter the Lord explains that the process of the eightfold yoga system
is a means to control the mind and the senses. However, this is very difficult
for people in general to perform, especially in the age of Kali. Although the
eightfold yoga system is recommended in this chapter, the Lord emphasizes that
the process of karma-yoga, or acting in Kåñëa consciousness, is better. Everyone
acts in this world to maintain his family and their paraphernalia, but no one is
working without some self-interest, some personal gratification, be it
concentrated or extended. The criterion of perfection is to act in Kåñëa
consciousness, and not with a view to enjoying the fruits of work. To act in
Kåñëa consciousness is the duty of every living entity because all are
constitutionally parts and parcels of the Supreme. The parts of the body work
for the satisfaction of the whole body. The limbs of the body do not act for
self-satisfaction but for the satisfaction of the complete whole. Similarly, the
living entity who acts for satisfaction of the supreme whole and not for
personal satisfaction is the perfect sannyäsé, the perfect yogé.

The sannyäsés sometimes artificially think that they have become liberated from
all material duties, and therefore they cease to perform agnihotra yajïas (fire
sacrifices), but actually they are self-interested because their goal is
becoming one with the impersonal Brahman. Such a desire is greater than any
material desire, but it is not without self-interest. Similarly, the mystic yogé
who practices the yoga system with half-open eyes, ceasing all material
activities, desires some satisfaction for his personal self. But a person acting
in Kåñëa consciousness works for the satisfaction of the whole, without
self-interest. A Kåñëa conscious person has no desire for self-satisfaction. His
criterion of success is the satisfaction of Kåñëa, and thus he is the perfect
sannyäsé, or perfect yogé. Lord Caitanya, the highest perfectional symbol of
renunciation, prays in this way:

na dhanaà na janaà na sundaréà kavitäà vä jagadéça kämaye.
mama janmani janmanéçvare bhavatäd bhaktir ahaituké tvayi.

"O Almighty Lord, I have no desire to accumulate wealth, nor to enjoy beautiful
women. Nor do I want any number of followers. What I want only is the causeless
mercy of Your devotional service in my life, birth after birth."

TRANSLATION
What is called renunciation is the same as yoga, or linking oneself with the
Supreme, for no one can become a yogé unless he renounces the desire for sense
gratification.

PURPORT
Real sannyäsa-yoga or bhakti means that one should know his constitutional
position as the living entity, and act accordingly. The living entity has no
separate independant identity. He is the marginal energy of the Supreme. When he
is entrapped by material energy, he is conditioned, and when he is Kåñëa
conscious, or aware of the spiritual energy, then he is in his real and natural
state of life. Therefore, when one is in complete knowledge, one ceases all
material sense gratification, or renounces all kinds of sense gratificatory
activities. This is practiced by the yogés who restrain the senses from material
attachment. But a person in Kåñëa consciousness has no opportunity to engage his
senses in anything which is not for the purpose of Kåñëa. Therefore, a Kåñëa
conscious person is simultaneously a sannyäsé and a yogé. The purpose of
knowledge and of restraining the senses, as prescribed in the jïäna and yoga
processes, is automatically served in Kåñëa consciousness. If one is unable to
give up the activities of his selfish nature, then jïäna and yoga are of no
avail. The real aim is for a living entity to give up all selfish satisfaction
and to be prepared to satisfy the Supreme. A Kåñëa conscious person has no
desire for any kind of self-enjoyment. He is always engaged for the enjoyment of
the Supreme. One who has no information of the Supreme must therefore be engaged
in self-satisfaction because no one can stand on the platform of inactivity. All
these purposes are perfectly served by the practice of Kåñëa consciousness.

TRANSLATION
For one who is a neophyte in the eightfold yoga system, work is said to be the
means; and for one who has already attained to yoga, cessation of all material
activities is said to be the means.

PURPORT
The process of linking oneself with the Supreme is called yoga, which may be
compared to a ladder for attaining the topmost spiritual realization. This
ladder begins from the lowest material condition of the living entity and rises
up to perfect self-realization in pure spiritual life. According to various
elevations, different parts of the ladder are known by different names. But all
in all, the complete ladder is called yoga and may be divided into three parts,
namely jïäna-yoga, dhyäna-yoga and bhakti-yoga. The beginning of the ladder is
called the yogärurukña stage, and the highest rung is called yogärüòha.

Concerning the eightfold yoga system, attempts in the beginning to enter into
meditation through regulative principles of life and practice of different
sitting postures (which are more or less bodily exercises) are considered
fruitive material activities. All such activities lead to achieving perfect
mental equilibrium to control the senses. When one is accomplished in the
practice of meditation, he ceases all disturbing mental activities.

A Kåñëa conscious person is, however, situated from the beginning on the
platform of meditation because he always thinks of Kåñëa. And, being constantly
engaged in the service of Kåñëa, he is considered to have ceased all material
activities.

TRANSLATION
A person is said to have attained to yoga when, having renounced all material
desires, he neither acts for sense gratification nor engages in fruitive
activities.

PURPORT
When a person is fully engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord,
he is pleased in himself, and thus he is no longer engaged in sense
gratification or in fruitive activities. Otherwise, one must be engaged in sense
gratification, since one cannot live without engagement. Without Kåñëa
consciousness, one must be always seeking self-centered or extended selfish
activities. But a Kåñëa conscious person can do everything for the satisfaction
of Kåñëa and thereby be perfectly detached from sense gratification. One who has
no such realization must mechanically try to escape material desires before
being elevated to the top rung of the yoga ladder.

TRANSLATION
A man must elevate himself by his own mind, not degrade himself. The mind is the
friend of the conditioned soul, and his enemy as well.

PURPORT
The word ätmä denotes body, mind and soul—depending upon different
circumstances. In the yoga system, the mind and the conditioned soul are
especially important. Since the mind is the central point of yoga practice, ätmä
refers here to the mind. The purpose of the yoga system is to control the mind
and to draw it away from attachment to sense objects. It is stressed herein that
the mind must be so trained that it can deliver the conditioned soul from the
mire of nescience. In material existence one is subjected to the influence of
the mind and the senses. In fact, the pure soul is entangled in the material
world because of the mind’s ego which desires to lord it over material nature.
Therefore, the mind should be trained so that it will not be attracted by the
glitter of material nature, and in this way the conditioned soul may be saved.
One should not degrade oneself by attraction to sense objects. The more one is
attracted by sense objects, the more one becomes entangled in material
existence. The best way to disentangle oneself is to always engage the mind in
Kåñëa consciousness. The word hi is used for emphasizing this point, i.e., that
one must do this. It is also said:

mana eva manuñyäëäà käraëaà bandha-mokñayoù
bandhäya viñayäsaìgo muktyai nirviñayaà manaù.

"For man, mind is the cause of bondage and mind is the cause of liberation. Mind
absorbed in sense objects is the cause of bondage, and mind detached from the
sense objects is the cause of liberation." Therefore, the mind which is always
engaged in Kåñëa consciousness is the cause of supreme liberation.

anätmanaù—of one who has failed to control the mind; tu—but; çatrutve—because of

TRANSLATION
For him who has conquered the mind, the mind is the best of friends; but for one
who has failed to do so, his very mind will be the greatest enemy.

PURPORT
The purpose of practicing eightfold yoga is to control the mind in order to make
it a friend in discharging the human mission. Unless the mind is controlled, the
practice of yoga (for show) is simply a waste of time. One who cannot control
his mind lives always with the greatest enemy, and thus his life and its mission
are spoiled. The constitutional position of the living entity is to carry out
the order of the superior. As long as one’s mind remains an unconquered enemy,
one has to serve the dictations of lust, anger, avarice, illusion, etc. But when
the mind is conquered, one voluntarily agrees to abide by the dictation of the
Personality of Godhead, who is situated within the heart of everyone as
Paramätmä. Real yoga practice entails meeting the Paramätmä within the heart and
then following His dictation. For one who takes to Kåñëa consciousness directly,
perfect surrender to the dictation of the Lord follows automatically.

TRANSLATION
For one who has conquered the mind, the Supersoul is already reached, for he has
attained tranquility. To such a man happiness and distress, heat and cold, honor
and dishonor are all the same.

PURPORT
Actually, every living entity is intended to abide by the dictation of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is seated in everyone’s heart as Paramätmä.
When the mind is misled by the external illusory energy, one becomes entangled
in material activities. Therefore, as soon as one’s mind is controlled through
one of the yoga systems, one is to be considered as having already reached the
destination. One has to abide by superior dictation. When one’s mind is fixed on
the superior nature, he has no other alternative but to follow the dictation of
the Supreme. The mind must admit some superior dictation and follow it. The
effect of controlling the mind is that one automatically follows the dictation
of the Paramätmä or Supersoul. Because this transcendental position is at once
achieved by one who is in Kåñëa consciousness, the devotee of the Lord is
unaffected by the dualities of material existence, namely distress and
happiness, cold and heat, etc. This state is practical samädhi, or absorption in
the Supreme.

TRANSLATION
A person is said to be established in self-realization and is called a yogé [or
mystic] when he is fully satisfied by virtue of acquired knowledge and
realization. Such a person is situated in transcendence and is self-controlled.
He sees everything—whether it be pebbles, stones or gold—as the same.

PURPORT
Book knowledge without realization of the Supreme Truth is useless. This is
stated as follows:

ataù çré-kåñëa-nämädi na bhaved grähyam indriyaiù
sevonmukhe hi jihvädau svayam eva sphuraty adaù.

"No one can understand the transcendental nature of the name, form, quality and
pastimes of Çré Kåñëa through his materially contaminated senses. Only when one
becomes spiritually saturated by transcendental service to the Lord are the
transcendental name, form, quality and pastimes of the Lord revealed to him."
(Padma Puräëa)

This Bhagavad-gétä is the science of Kåñëa consciousness. No one can become
Kåñëa conscious simply by mundane scholarship. One must be fortunate enough to
associate with a person who is in pure consciousness. A Kåñëa conscious person
has realized knowledge, by the grace of Kåñëa, because he is satisfied with pure
devotional service. By realized knowledge, one becomes perfect. By
transcendental knowledge one can remain steady in his convictions, but by mere
academic knowledge one can be easily deluded and confused by apparent
contradictions. It is the realized soul who is actually self-controlled because
he is surrendered to Kåñëa. He is transcendental because he has nothing to do
with mundane scholarship. For him mundane scholarship and mental speculation,
which may be as good as gold to others, are of no greater value than pebbles or
stones.

satatam—constantly; ätmänam—himself (by the body, mind and self); rahasi—in a
secluded place; sthitaù—being so situated; ekäké—alone; yata-cittätmä—always

TRANSLATION
A transcendentalist should always try to concentrate his mind on the Supreme
Self; he should live alone in a secluded place and should always carefully
control his mind. He should be free from desires and feelings of possessiveness.

PURPORT
Kåñëa is realized in different degrees as Brahman, Paramätmä and the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. Kåñëa consciousness means, concisely, to be always
engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. But those who are
attached to the impersonal Brahman or the localized Supersoul are also partially
Kåñëa conscious, because impersonal Brahman is the spiritual ray of Kåñëa and
Supersoul is the all-pervading partial expansion of Kåñëa. Thus the
impersonalist and the meditator are also indirectly Kåñëa conscious. A directly
Kåñëa conscious person is the topmost transcendentalist because such a devotee
knows what is meant by Brahman or Paramätmä. His knowledge of the Absolute Truth
is perfect, whereas the impersonalist and the meditative yogé are imperfectly
Kåñëa conscious.

Nevertheless, all of these are instructed herewith to be constantly engaged in
their particular pursuits so that they may come to the highest perfection sooner
or later. The first business of a transcendentalist is to keep the mind always
on Kåñëa. One should always think of Kåñëa and not forget Him even for a moment.
Concentration of the mind on the Supreme is called samädhi or trance. In order
to concentrate the mind, one should always remain in seclusion and avoid
disturbance by external objects. He should be very careful to accept favorable
and reject unfavorable conditions that affect his realization. And, in perfect
determination, he should not hanker after unnecessary material things that
entangle him by feelings of possessiveness.

All these perfections and precautions are perfectly executed when one is
directly in Kåñëa consciousness because direct Kåñëa consciousness means
self-abnegation, wherein there is very little chance for material
possessiveness. Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé characterizes Kåñëa consciousness in this
way:

anäsaktasya viñayän yathärham upayuïjataù
nirbandhaù kåñëa-sambandhe yuktaà vairägyam ucyate
präpaïcikatayä buddhyä hari-sambandhi-vastunaù
mumukñubhiù parityägo vairägyaà phalgu kathyate.

(Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu 2.255–256)

"When one is not attached to anything, but at the same time accepts everything
in relation to Kåñëa, one is rightly situated above possessiveness. On the other
hand, one who rejects everything without knowledge of its relationship to Kåñëa
is not as complete in his renunciation."

A Kåñëa conscious person well knows that everything belongs to Kåñëa, and thus
he is always free from feelings of personal possession. As such, he has no
hankering for anything on his own personal account. He knows how to accept
things in favor of Kåñëa consciousness and how to reject things unfavorable to
Kåñëa consciousness. He is always aloof from material things because he is
always transcendental, and he is always alone, having nothing to do with persons
not in Kåñëa consciousness. Therefore a person in Kåñëa consciousness is the
perfect yogé.

TRANSLATION
To practice yoga, one should go to a secluded place and should lay kuça-grass on
the ground and then cover it with a deerskin and a soft cloth. The seat should
neither be too high nor too low and should be situated in a sacred place. The
yogé should then sit on it very firmly and should practice yoga by controlling
the mind and the senses, purifying the heart and fixing the mind on one point.

PURPORT
"Sacred place" refers to places of pilgrimage. In India the yogés, the
transcendentalists or the devotees all leave home and reside in sacred places
such as Prayäg, Mathurä, Våndävana, Håñékeça, and Hardwar and in solitude
practice yoga where the sacred rivers like the Yamunä and the Ganges flow. But
often this is not possible, especially for Westerners. The so-called yoga
societies in big cities may be successful in earning material benefit, but they
are not at all suitable for the actual practice of yoga. One who is not
self-controlled and whose mind is not undisturbed cannot practice meditation.
Therefore, in the Båhan-Näradéya Puräëa it is said that in the Kali-yuga (the
present yuga or age) when people in general are short-lived, slow in spiritual
realization and always disturbed by various anxieties, the best means of
spiritual realization is chanting the holy name of the Lord.

harer näma harer näma harer nämaiva kevalam
kalau nästy eva nästy eva nästy eva gatir anyathä.

"In this age of quarrel and hypocrisy the only means of deliverance is chanting
the holy name of the Lord. There is no other way. There is no other way. There
is no other way."

TRANSLATION
One should hold one’s body, neck and head erect in a straight line and stare
steadily at the tip of the nose. Thus with an unagitated, subdued mind, devoid
of fear, completely free from sex life, one should meditate upon Me within the
heart and make Me the ultimate goal of life.

PURPORT
The goal of life is to know Kåñëa, who is situated within the heart of every
living being as Paramätmä, the four-handed Viñëu form. The yoga process is
practiced in order to discover and see this localized form of Viñëu, and not for
any other purpose. The localized Viñëu-mürti is the plenary representation of
Kåñëa dwelling within one’s heart. One who has no program to realize this
Viñëu-murti is uselessly engaged in mock-yoga practice and is certainly wasting
his time. Kåñëä is the ultimate goal of life, and the Viñëu-murti situated in
one’s heart is the object of yoga practice. To realize this Viñëu-murti within
the heart, one has to observe complete abstinence from sex life; therefore one
has to leave home and live alone in a secluded place, remaining seated as
mentioned above. One cannot enjoy sex life daily at home or elsewhere and attend
a so-called yoga class and thus become a yogé. One has to practice controlling
the mind and avoiding all kinds of sense gratification, of which sex life is the
chief. In the rules of celibacy written by the great sage Yäjïavalkya it is
said:

karmaëä manasä väcä sarvävasthäsu sarvadä
sarvatra maithuëa-tyägo brahmacaryaà pracakñate.

"The vow of brahmacarya is meant to help one completely abstain from sex
indulgence in work, words and mind—at all times, under all circumstances, and in
all places." No one can perform correct yoga practice through sex indulgence.
Brahmacarya is taught, therefore, from childhood when one has no knowledge of
sex life. Children at the age of five are sent to the guru-kula, or the place of
the spiritual master, and the master trains the young boys in the strict
discipline of becoming brahmacärés. Without such practice, no one can make
advancement in any yoga, whether it be dhyäna, jïäna or bhakti. One who,
however, follows the rules and regulations of married life, having sexual
relationship only with his wife (and that also under regulation), is also called
brahmacäré. Such a restrained householder brahmacäré may be accepted in the
bhakti school, but the jïäna and dhyäna schools do not admit even householder
brahmacärés. They require complete abstinence without compromise. In the bhakti
school, a householder brahmacäré is allowed controlled sex life because the cult
of bhakti-yoga is so powerful that one automatically loses sexual attraction,
being engaged in the superior service of the Lord. In the Bhagavad-gétä it is
said:

viñayä vinivartante nirähärasya dehinaù
rasa-varjaà raso ’py asya paraà dåñövä nivartate

Whereas others are forced to restrain themselves from sense gratification, a
devotee of the Lord automatically refrains because of superior taste. Other than
the devotee, no one has any information of that superior taste.

Vigatabhéù. One cannot be fearless unless one is fully in Kåñëa consciousness. A
conditioned soul is fearful due to his perverted memory, his forgetfulness of
his eternal relationship with Kåñëa. The Bhägavatam says, bhayaà
dvitéyäbhiniveçataù syäd éçäd apetasya viparyayo ‘småtiù: Kåñëa consciousness is
the only basis for fearlessness. Therefore, perfect practice is possible for a
person who is Kåñëa conscious. And since the ultimate goal of yoga practice is
to see the Lord within, a Kåñëa conscious person is already the best of all
yogés. The principles of the yoga system mentioned herein are different from
those of the popular so-called yoga societies.

TRANSLATION
Thus practicing control of the body, mind and activities, the mystic
transcendentalist attains to the kingdom of God [or the abode of Kåñëa] by
cessation of material existence.

PURPORT
The ultimate goal in practicing yoga is now clearly explained. Yoga practice is
not meant for attaining any kind of material facility; it is to enable the
cessation of all material existence. One who seeks an improvement in health or
aspires after material perfection is no yogé according to Bhagavad-gétä. Nor
does cessation of material existence entail one’s entering into "the void,"
which is only a myth. There is no void anywhere within the creation of the Lord.
Rather, the cessation of material existence enables one to enter into the
spiritual sky, the abode of the Lord. The abode of the Lord is also clearly
described in the Bhagavad-gétä as that place where there is no need of sun,
moon, nor electricity. All the planets in the spiritual kingdom are
self-illuminated like the sun in the material sky. The kingdom of God is
everywhere, but the spiritual sky and the planets thereof are called paraà
dhäma, or superior abodes.

A consummate yogé, who is perfect in understanding Lord Kåñëa, as is clearly
stated herein (mat-cittaù, mat-paraù, mat-sthänam) by the Lord Himself, can
attain real peace and can ultimately reach His supreme abode, the Kåñëa-loka
known as Goloka Våndävana. In the Brahma-saàhitä it is clearly stated (goloka
eva nivasaty akhilätma-bhütaù) that the Lord, although residing always in His
abode called Goloka, is the all-pervading Brahman and the localized Paramätmä as
well by dint of His superior spiritual energies. No one can reach the spiritual
sky or enter into the eternal abode (Vaikuëöha Goloka Våndävana) of the Lord
without the proper understanding of Kåñëa and His plenary expansion Viñëu.
Therefore a person working in Kåñëa consciousness is the perfect yogé, because
his mind is always absorbed in Kåñëa’s activities. Sa vai manaù
kåñëa-padäravindayoù. In the Vedas also we learn: tam eva viditvätimåtyum eti:
"One can overcome the path of birth and death only by understanding the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa." In other words, perfection of the yoga system is
the attainment of freedom from material existence and not some magical jugglery
or gymnastic feats to befool innocent people.

TRANSLATION
There is no possibility of one’s becoming a yogé, O Arjuna, if one eats too
much, or eats too little, sleeps too much or does not sleep enough.

PURPORT
Regulation of diet and sleep is recommended herein for the yogés. Too much
eating means eating more than is required to keep the body and soul together.
There is no need for men to eat animals because there is an ample supply of
grains, vegetables, fruits and milk. Such simple foodstuff is considered to be
in the mode of goodness according to the Bhagavad-gétä. Animal food is for those
in the mode of ignorance. Therefore, those who indulge in animal food, drinking,
smoking and eating food which is not first offered to Kåñëa will suffer sinful
reactions because of eating only polluted things. Bhuïjate te tv aghaà papa ye
pacanty ätma-käraëät. Anyone who eats for sense pleasure, or cooks for himself,
not offering his food to Kåñëa, eats only sin. One who eats sin and eats more
than is allotted to him cannot execute perfect yoga. It is best that one eat
only the remnants of foodstuff offered to Kåñëa. A person in Kåñëa consciousness
does not eat anything which is not first offered to Kåñëa. Therefore, only the
Kåñëa conscious person can attain perfection in yoga practice. Nor can one who
artificially abstains from eating, manufacturing his own personal process of
fasting, practice yoga. The Kåñëa conscious person observes fasting as it is
recommended in the scriptures. He does not fast or eat more than is required,
and he is thus competent to perform yoga practice. One who eats more than
required will dream very much while sleeping, and he must consequently sleep
more than is required. One should not sleep more than six hours daily. One who
sleeps more than six hours out of twenty-four is certainly influenced by the
mode of ignorance. A person in the mode of ignorance is lazy and prone to sleep
a great deal. Such a person cannot perform yoga.

TRANSLATION
He who is temperate in his habits of eating, sleeping, working and recreation
can mitigate all material pains by practicing the yoga system.

PURPORT
Extravagance in the matter of eating, sleeping, defending and mating—which are
demands of the body—can block advancement in the practice of yoga. As far as
eating is concerned, it can be regulated only when one is practiced to take and
accept prasädam, sanctified food. Lord Kåñëa is offered, according to the
Bhagavad-gétä (Bg. 9.26), vegetables, flowers, fruits, grains, milk, etc. In
this way, a person in Kåñëa consciousness becomes automatically trained not to
accept food not meant for human consumption, or which is not in the category of
goodness. As far as sleeping is concerned, a Kåñëa conscious person is always
alert in the discharge of his duties in Kåñëa consciousness, and therefore any
unnecessary time spent sleeping is considered a great loss. A Kåñëa conscious
person cannot bear to pass a minute of his life without being engaged in the
service of the Lord. Therefore, his sleeping is kept to a minimum. His ideal in
this respect is Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé, who was always engaged in the service of
Kåñëa and who could not sleep more than two hours a day, and sometimes not even
that. Öhäkura Haridäsa would not even accept prasädam nor even sleep for a
moment without finishing his daily routine of chanting with his beads three
hundred thousand names. As far as work is concerned, a Kåñëa conscious person
does not do anything which is not connected with Kåñëa’s interest, and thus his
work is always regulated and is untainted by sense gratification. Since there is
no question of sense gratification, there is no material leisure for a person in
Kåñëa consciousness. And because he is regulated in all his work, speech, sleep,
wakefulness and all other bodily activities, there is no material misery for
him.

TRANSLATION
When the yogé, by practice of yoga, disciplines his mental activities and
becomes situated in Transcendence—devoid of all material desires—he is said to
have attained yoga.

PURPORT
The activities of the yogé are distinguished from those of an ordinary person by
his characteristic cessation from all kinds of material desires—of which sex is
the chief. A perfect yogé is so well disciplined in the activities of the mind
that he can no longer be disturbed by any kind of material desire. This
perfectional stage can automatically be attained by persons in Kåñëa
consciousness, as is stated in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam (9.4.18–20):

sa vai manaù kåñëa-padäravindayor vacäàsi vaikuëöha-guëänavarëane
karau harer mandira-märjanädiñu çrutià cakäräcyuta-sat-kathodaye

kämaà ca däsye na tu käma-kämyayä yathottama-çloka-janäçrayä ratiù

"King Ambaréña first of all engaged his mind on the lotus feet of Lord Kåñëa;
then, one after another, he engaged his words in describing the transcendental
qualities of the Lord, his hands in mopping the temple of the Lord, his ears in
hearing of the activities of the Lord, his eyes in seeing the transcendental
forms of the Lord, his body in touching the bodies of the devotees, his sense of
smell in smelling the scents of the lotus flower offered to the Lord, his tongue
in tasting the tulasé leaf offered at the lotus feet of the Lord, his legs in
going to places of pilgrimage and the temple of the Lord, his head in offering
obeisances unto the Lord and his desires in executing the mission of the Lord.
All these transcendental activities are quite befitting a pure devotee."

This transcendental stage may be inexpressible subjectively by the followers of
the impersonalist path, but it becomes very easy and practical for a person in
Kåñëa consciousness, as is apparent in the above description of the engagements
of Mahäräja Ambaréña. Unless the mind is fixed on the lotus feet of the Lord by
constant remembrance, such transcendental engagements are not practical. In the
devotional service of the Lord, therefore, these prescribed activities are
called arcanä, or engaging all the senses in the service of the Lord. The senses
and the mind require engagements. Simple abnegation is not practical. Therefore,
for people in general—especially those who are not in the renounced order of
life—transcendental engagement of the senses and the mind as described above is
the perfect process for transcendental achievement, which is called yukta in the
Bhagavad-gétä.

TRANSLATION
The stage of perfection is called trance, or samädhi, when one’s mind is
completely restrained from material mental activities by practice of yoga. This
is characterized by one’s ability to see the self by the pure mind and to relish
and rejoice in the self. In that joyous state, one is situated in boundless
transcendental happiness and enjoys himself through transcendental senses.
Established thus, one never departs from the truth, and upon gaining this he
thinks there is no greater gain. Being situated in such a position, one is never
shaken, even in the midst of greatest difficulty. This indeed is actual freedom
from all miseries arising from material contact.

PURPORT
By practice of yoga one becomes gradually detached from material concepts. This
is the primary characteristic of the yoga principle. And after this, one becomes
situated in trance, or samädhi which means that the yogé realizes the Supersoul
through transcendental mind and intelligence, without any of the misgivings of
identifying the self with the Superself. Yoga practice is more or less based on
the principles of the Pataïjali system. Some unauthorized commentators try to
identify the individual soul with the Supersoul, and the monists think this to
be liberation, but they do not understand the real purpose of the Pataïjali
system of yoga. There is an acceptance of transcendental pleasure in the
Pataïjali system, but the monists do not accept this transcendental pleasure out
of fear of jeopardizing the theory of oneness. The duality of knowledge and
knower is not accepted by the nondualist, but in this verse transcendental
pleasure—realized through transcendental senses—is accepted. And this is
corroborated by the Pataïjali Muni, the famous exponent of the yoga system. The
great sage declares in his Yoga-sütras: puruñärtha-çünyänäà guëänäà
pratiprasavaù kaivalyaà svarüpa-pratiñöhä vä citi-çaktir iti.

This citi-çakti, or internal potency, is transcendental. Puruñärtha means
material religiosity, economic development, sense gratification and, at the end,
the attempt to become one with the Supreme. This "oneness with the Supreme" is
called kaivalyam by the monist. But according to Pataïjali, this kaivalyam is an
internal, or transcendental, potency by which the living entity becomes aware of
his constitutional position. In the words of Lord Caitanya, this state of
affairs is called ceto-darpaëa-märjanam, or clearance of the impure mirror of
the mind. This "clearance" is actually liberation, or
bhava-mahädävägni-nirväpaëam. The theory of nirväëa—also preliminary—corresponds
with this principle. In the Bhägavatam this is called svarüpeëa vyavasthitiù.
The Bhagavad-gétä also confirms this situation in this verse.

After nirväëa, or material cessation, there is the manifestation of spiritual
activities, or devotional service of the Lord, known as Kåñëa consciousness. In
the words of the Bhägavatam, svarüpeëa vyavasthitiù: this is the "real life of
the living entity." Mäyä, or illusion, is the condition of spiritual life
contaminated by material infection. Liberation from this material infection does
not mean destruction of the original eternal position of the living entity.
Pataïjali also accepts this by his words kaivalyam svarüpa-pratiñöhä vä
citi-çaktir iti. This citi-çakti or transcendental pleasure, is real life. This
is confirmed in the Vedänta-sütras as änandamayo ’bhyäsät. This natural
transcendental pleasure is the ultimate goal of yoga and is easily achieved by
execution of devotional service, or bhakti-yoga. Bhaktiyoga will be vividly
described in the Seventh Chapter of Bhagavad-gétä.

In the yoga system, as described in this chapter, there are two kinds of
samädhi, called samprajïäta-samädhi and asamprajïäta-samädhi. When one becomes
situated in the transcendental position by various philosophical researches, it
is called samprajïäta-samädhi. In the asamprajïäta-samädhi there is no longer
any connection with mundane pleasure, for one is then transcendental to all
sorts of happiness derived from the senses. When the yogé is once situated in
that transcendental position, he is never shaken from it. Unless the yogé is
able to reach this position, he is unsuccessful. Today’s so-called yoga
practice, which involves various sense pleasures, is contradictory. A yogé
indulging in sex and intoxication is a mockery. Even those yogés who are
attracted by the siddhis (perfections) in the process of yoga are not perfectly
situated. If the yogés are attracted by the by-products of yoga, then they
cannot attain the stage of perfection, as is stated in this verse. Persons,
therefore, indulging in the make-show practice of gymnastic feats or siddhis
should know that the aim of yoga is lost in that way.

The best practice of yoga in this age is Kåñëa consciousness, which is not
baffling. A Kåñëa conscious person is so happy in his occupation that he does
not aspire after any other happiness. There are many impediments, especially in
this age of hypocrisy, to practicing haöha-yoga, dhyäna-yoga, and jïäna-yoga,
but there is no such problem in executing karma-yoga or bhakti-yoga.

As long as the material body exists, one has to meet the demands of the body,
namely eating, sleeping, defending and mating. But a person who is in pure
bhakti-yoga or in Kåñëa consciousness does not arouse the senses while meeting
the demands of the body. Rather, he accepts the bare necessities of life, making
the best use of a bad bargain, and enjoys transcendental happiness in Kåñëa
consciousness. He is callous toward incidental occurrences—such as accidents,
disease, scarcity and even the death of a most dear relative—but he is always
alert to execute his duties in Kåñëa consciousness or bhakti-yoga. Accidents
never deviate him from his duty. As stated in the Bhagavad-gétä, ägamäpäyino
’nityäs täàs titikñasva bhärata. He endures all such incidental occurences
because he knows that they come and go and do not affect his duties. In this way
he achieves the highest perfection in yoga practice.

TRANSLATION
One should engage oneself in the practice of yoga with undeviating determination
and faith. One should abandon, without exception, all material desires born of
false ego and thus control all the senses on all sides by the mind.

PURPORT
The yoga practitioner should be determined and should patiently prosecute the
practice without deviation. One should be sure of success at the end and pursue
this course with great perserverance, not becoming discouraged if there is any
delay in the attainment of success. Success is sure for the rigid practitioner.
Regarding bhakti-yoga, Rupa Gosvämé says:

utsähän niçcayäd dhairyät tat tat karma-pravartanät
saìga-tyägät satovåtteù ñaòbhir bhaktiù prasidhyati

"The process of bhakti-yoga can be executed successfully with full-hearted
enthusiasm, perseverance, and determination by following the prescribed duties
in the association of devotees and by engaging completely in activities of
goodness."

As for determination, one should follow the example of the sparrow who lost her
eggs in the waves of the ocean. A sparrow laid her eggs on the shore of the
ocean, but the big ocean carried away the eggs on its waves. The sparrow became
very upset and asked the ocean to return her eggs. The ocean did not even
consider her appeal. So the sparrow decided to dry up the ocean. She began to
pick out the water in her small beak, and everyone laughed at her for her
impossible determination. The news of her activity spread, and at last Garuòa,
the gigantic bird carrier of Lord Viñëu, heard it. He became compassionate
toward his small sister bird, and so he came to see the sparrow. Garuòa was very
pleased by the determination of the small sparrow, and he promised to help. Thus
Garuòa at once asked the ocean to return her eggs lest he himself take up the
work of the sparrow. The ocean was frightened at this, and returned the eggs.
Thus the sparrow became happy by the grace of Garuòa.

Similarly, the practice of yoga, especially bhakti-yoga in Kåñëa consciousness,
may appear to be a very difficult job. But if anyone follows the principles with
great determination, the Lord will surely help, for God helps those who help
themselves.

TRANSLATION
Gradually, step by step, with full conviction, one should become situated in
trance by means of intelligence, and thus the mind should be fixed on the Self
alone and should think of nothing else.

PURPORT
By proper conviction and intelligence one should gradually cease sense
activities. This is called pratyähära. The mind, being controlled by conviction,
meditation, and cessation of the senses, should be situated in trance, or
samädhi. At that time there is no longer any danger of becoming engaged in the
material conception of life. In other words, although one is involved with
matter as long as the material body exists, one should not think about sense
gratification. One should think of no pleasure aside from the pleasure of the
Supreme Self. This state is easily attained by directly practicing Kåñëa
consciousness.

TRANSLATION
From whatever and wherever the mind wanders due to its flickering and unsteady
nature, one must certainly withdraw it and bring it back under the control of
the Self.

PURPORT
The nature of the mind is flickering and unsteady. But a self-realized yogé has
to control the mind; the mind should not control him. One who controls the mind
(and therefore the senses as well) is called gosvämé, or svämé, and one who is
controlled by the mind is called godäsa, or the servant of the senses. A gosvämé
knows the standard of sense happiness. In transcendental sense happiness, the
senses are engaged in the service of Håñékeça or the supreme owner of the
senses—Kåñëa. Serving Kåñëa with purified senses is called Kåñëa consciousness.
That is the way of bringing the senses under full control. What is more, that is
the highest perfection of yoga practice.

The yogé whose mind is fixed on Me verily attains the highest happiness. By
virtue of his identity with Brahman, he is liberated; his mind is peaceful, his
passions are quieted, and he is freed from sin.

PURPORT
Brahma-bhüta is the state of being free from material contamination and situated
in the transcendental service of the Lord. Mad-bhaktim labhate paräm (Bg.
18.54). One cannot remain in the quality of Brahman, the Absolute, until one’s
mind is fixed on the lotus feet of the Lord. Sa vai manaù kåñëa-padäravindayoù.
To be always engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, or to
remain in Kåñëa consciousness, is to be factually liberated from the mode of
passion and all material contamination.

Consciousness.

PURPORT
Self-realization means knowing one’s constitutional position in relationship to
the Supreme. The individual soul is part and parcel of the Supreme, and his
position is to render transcendental service to the Lord. This transcendental
contact with the Supreme is called brahma-saàsparça.

TRANSLATION
A true yogé observes Me in all beings, and also sees every being in Me. Indeed,
the self-realized man sees Me everywhere.

PURPORT
A Kåñëa conscious yogé is the perfect seer because he sees Kåñëa, the Supreme,
situated in everyone’s heart as Supersoul (Paramätmä). Éçvaraù sarva-bhütänäà
håd-deçe ’rjuna tiñöhati. The Lord in His Paramätmä feature is situated within
both the heart of the dog and that of a brähmaëa. The perfect yogé knows that
the Lord is eternally transcendental and is not materially affected by His
presence in either a dog or a brähmaëa. That is the supreme neutrality of the
Lord. The individual soul is also situated in the individual heart, but he is
not present in all hearts. That is the distinction between the individual soul
and the Supersoul. One who is not factually in the practice of yoga cannot see
so clearly. A Kåñëa conscious person can see Kåñëa in the heart of both the
believer and nonbeliever. In the småti this is confirmed as follows: ätatatväc
ca mätåtväd ätmä hi paramo hariù.

The Lord, being the source of all beings, is like the mother and the maintainer.
As the mother is neutral to all different kinds of children, the Supreme Father
(or Mother) is also. Consequently the Supersoul is always in every living being.
Outwardly, also, every living being is situated in the energy of the Lord. As
will be explained in the Seventh Chapter, the Lord has, primarily, two
energies—the spiritual (or superior) and the material (or inferior). The living
entity, although part of the superior energy, is conditioned by the inferior
energy; the living entity is always in the Lord’s energy. Every living entity is
situated in Him in one way or another. The yogé sees equally because he sees
that all living entities, although in different situations according to the
results of fruitive work, in all circumstances remain the servants of God. While
in the material energy, the living entity serves the material senses; and while
in spiritual energy, he serves the Supreme Lord directly. In either case the
living entity is the servant of God. This vision of equality is perfect in a
person in Kåñëa consciousness.

TRANSLATION
For one who sees Me everywhere and sees everything in Me, I am never lost, nor
is he ever lost to Me.

PURPORT
A person in Kåñëa consciousness certainly sees Lord Kåñëa everywhere, and he
sees everything in Kåñëa. Such a person may appear to see all separate
manifestations of the material nature, but in each and every instance he is
conscious of Kåñëa, knowing that everything is the manifestation of Kåñëa’s
energy. Nothing can exist without Kåñëa, and Kåñëa is the Lord of
everything—this is the basic principle of Kåñëa consciousness.

Kåñëa consciousness is the development of love of Kåñëa—a position
transcendental even to material liberation. It is the stage beyond
self-realization at which the devotee becomes one with Kåñëa in the sense that
Kåñëa becomes everything for the devotee, and the devotee becomes full in loving
Kåñëa. An intimate relationship between the Lord and the devotee then exists. In
that stage, the living entity attains his immortality. Nor is the Personality of
Godhead ever out of the sight of the devotee. To merge in Kåñëa is spiritual
annihilation. A devotee takes no such risk. It is stated in the Brahma-saàhitä:

premäïjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena
santaù sadaiva hådayeñu vilokayanti
yaà çyämasundaram acintya-guëa-svarüpaà
govindam ädi-puruñaà tam ahaà bhajämi

“I worship the primeval Lord, Govinda, who is always seen by the devotee whose
eyes are anointed with the pulp of love. He is seen in His eternal form of
Çyämasundara situated within the heart of the devotee." (Bs. 5.38)

At this stage, Lord Kåñëa never disappears from the sight of the devotee, nor
does the devotee ever lose sight of the Lord. In the case of a yogé who sees the
Lord as Paramätmä within the heart, the same applies. Such a yogé turns into a
pure devotee and cannot bear to live for a moment with out seeing the Lord
within himself.

TRANSLATION
The yogé who knows that I and the Supersoul within all creatures are one
worships Me and remains always in Me in all circumstances.

PURPORT
A yogé who is practicing meditation on the Supersoul sees within himself the
plenary portion of Kåñëa as Viñëu—with four hands, holding conchshell, wheel,
club and lotus flower. The yogé should know that Viñëu is not different from
Kåñëa. Kåñëa in this form of Supersoul is situated in everyone’s heart.
Furthermore, there is no difference between the innumerable Supersouls present
in the innumerable hearts of living entities. Nor is there a difference between
a Kåñëa conscious person always engaged in the transcendental loving service of
Kåñëa and a perfect yogé engaged in meditation on the Supersoul. The yogé in
Kåñëa consciousness—even though he may be engaged in various activities while in
material existence—remains always situated in Kåñëa. This is confirmed in the
Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu of Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé: nikhileñu avasthäsu jévanmukta sa
ucyate. A devotee of the Lord, always acting in Kåñëa consciousness, is
automatically liberated. In the Närada-païcarätra this is confirmed in this way:

dik-kälädy-anavacchinne kåñëe ceto vidhäya ca
tanmayo bhavati kñipraà jévo brahmaëi yojayet.

"By concentrating one’s attention on the transcendental form of Kåñëa, who is
all-pervading and beyond time and space, one becomes absorbed in thinking of
Kåñëa and then attains the happy state of transcendental association with Him."

Kåñëa consciousness is the highest stage of trance in yoga practice. This very
understanding that Kåñëa is present as Paramätmä in everyone’s heart makes the
yogé faultless. The Vedas confirm this inconceivable potency of the Lord as
follows:

eko ’pi san bahudhä yo ’vabhäti
aiçvaryäd rüpam ekaà ca süryavad bahudheyate.

"Viñëu is one, and yet He is certainly all-pervading. By His inconceivable
potency, in spite of His one form, He is present everywhere. As the sun, He
appears in many places at once."

TRANSLATION
He is a perfect yogé who, by comparison to his own self, sees the true equality
of all beings, both in their happiness and distress, O Arjuna!

PURPORT
One who is Kåñëa conscious is a perfect yogé; he is aware of everyone’s
happiness and distress by dint of his own personal experience. The cause of the
distress of a living entity is forgetfulness of his relationship with God. And
the cause of happiness is knowing Kåñëa to be the supreme enjoyer of all the
activities of the human being. Kåñëa is the proprietor of all lands and planets.
The perfect yogé is the sincerest friend of all living entities. He knows that
the living being who is conditioned by the modes of material nature is subjected
to the threefold material miseries due to forgetfulness of his relationship with
Kåñëa. Because one in Kåñëa consciousness is happy, he tries to distribute the
knowledge of Kåñëa everywhere. Since the perfect yogé tries to broadcast the
importance of becoming Kåñëa conscious, he is the best philanthropist in the
world, and he is the dearest servitor of the Lord. Na tasmät kaçcid me priyakåt
tamaù. In other words, a devotee of the Lord always looks to the welfare of all
living entities, and in this way he is factually the friend of everyone. He is
the best yogé because he does not desire perfection in yoga for his personal
benefit, but tries for others also. He does not envy his fellow living entities.
Here is a contrast between a pure devotee of the Lord and a yogé interested only
in his personal elevation. The yogé who has withdrawn to a secluded place in
order to meditate perfectly may not be as perfect as a devotee who is trying his
best to turn every man toward Kåñëa consciousness.

TRANSLATION
Arjuna said: O Madhusüdana, the system of yoga which you have summarized appears
impractical and unendurable to me, for the mind is restless and unsteady.

PURPORT
The system of mysticism described by Lord Kåñëa to Arjuna beginning with the
words çucau deçe and ending with yogé paramaù is here being rejected by Arjuna
out of a feeling of inability. It is not possible for an ordinary man to leave
home and go to a secluded place in the mountains or jungles to practice yoga in
this age of Kali. The present age is characterized by a bitter struggle for a
life of short duration. People are not serious about self-realization even by
simple, practical means, and what to speak of this difficult yoga system, which
regulates the mode of living, the manner of sitting, selection of place, and
detachment of the mind from material engagements. As a practical man, Arjuna
thought it was impossible to follow this system of yoga, even though he was
favorably endowed in many ways. He belonged to the royal family and was highly
elevated in terms of numerous qualities; he was a great warrior, he had great
longevity, and, above all, he was the most intimate friend of Lord Kåñëa, the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. Five thousand years ago, Arjuna had much better
facilities then we do now, yet he refused to accept this system of yoga. In
fact, we do not find any record in history of his practicing it at any time.
Therefore this system must be considered generally impossible in this age of
Kali. Of course it may be possible for some very few, rare men, but for the
people in general it is an impossible proposal. If this were so five thousand
years ago, then what of the present day? Those who are imitating this yoga
system in different so-called schools and societies, although complacent, are
certainly wasting their time. They are completely in ignorance of the desired
goal.

TRANSLATION
For the mind is restless, turbulent, obstinate and very strong, O Kåñëa, and to
subdue it is, it seems to me, more difficult than controlling the wind.

PURPORT
The mind is so strong and obstinate that it sometimes overcomes the
intelligence, although mind is supposed to be subservient to the intelligence.
For a man in the practical world who has to fight so many opposing elements, it
is certainly very difficult to control the mind. Artificially, one may establish
a mental equilibrium toward both friend and enemy, but ultimately no worldly man
can do so, for this is more difficult than controlling the raging wind. In the
Vedic literatures it is said:

ätmänaà rathinaà viddhi çaréraà ratham eva ca
buddhintu särathià viddhi manaù pragraham eva ca
indriyäëi hayänähur viñayäàs teñu gocarän
ätmendriya-mano-yukto bhoktety ähur manéñiëaù.

"The individual is the passenger in the car of the material body, and
intelligence is the driver. Mind is the driving instrument, and the senses are
the horses. The self is thus the enjoyer or sufferer in the association of the
mind and senses. So it is understood by great thinkers." Intelligence is
supposed to direct the mind, but the mind is so strong and obstinate that it
often overcomes even one’s own intelligence. Such a strong mind is supposed to
be controlled by the practice of yoga, but such practice is never practical for
a worldly person like Arjuna. And what can we say of modern man? The simile used
here is appropriate: one cannot capture the blowing wind. And it is even more
difficult to capture the turbulent mind. The easiest way to control the mind, as
suggested by Lord Caitanya, is chanting "Hare Kåñëa," the great mantra for
deliverance, in all humility. The method prescribed is sa vai manaù
kåñëa-padäravindayoù: one must engage one’s mind fully in Kåñëa. Only then will
there remain no other engagements to agitate the mind.

TRANSLATION
The Blessed Lord said: O mighty-armed son of Kunté, it is undoubtedly very
difficult to curb the restless mind, but it is possible by constant practice and
by detachment.

PURPORT
The difficulty of controlling the obstinate mind, as expressed by Arjuna, is
accepted by the Personality of Godhead. But at the same time He suggests that by
practice and detachment it is possible. What is that practice? In the present
age no one can observe strict rules and regulations, such as placing oneself in
a sacred place, focusing the mind on the Supersoul, restraining the senses and
mind, observing celibacy, remaining alone, etc. By the practice of Kåñëa
consciousness, however, one engages in nine types of devotional service to the
Lord. The first and foremost of such devotional engagements is hearing about
Kåñëa. This is a very powerful transcendental method for purging the mind of all
misgivings. The more one hears about Kåñëa, the more one becomes enlightened and
detached from everything that draws the mind away from Kåñëa. By detaching the
mind from activities not devoted to the Lord, one can very easily learn
vairägya. Vairägya means detachment from matter and engagement of the mind in
spirit. Impersonal spiritual detachment is more difficult than attaching the
mind to the activities of Kåñëa. This is practical because by hearing about
Kåñëa one becomes automatically attached to the Supreme Spirit. This attachment
is called pareçänubhüti spiritual satisfaction. It is just like the feeling of
satisfaction a hungry man has for every morsel of food he eats. Similarly, by
discharge of devotional service, one feels transcendental satisfaction as the
mind becomes detached from material objectives. It is something like curing a
disease by expert treatment and appropriate diet. Hearing of the transcendental
activities of Lord Kåñëa is therefore expert treatment for the mad mind, and
eating the foodstuff offered to Kåñëa is the appropriate diet for the suffering
patient. This treatment is the process of Kåñëa consciousness.

TRANSLATION
For one whose mind is unbridled, self-realization is difficult work. But he
whose mind is controlled and who strives by right means is assured of success.
That is My opinion.

PURPORT
The Supreme Personality of Godhead declares that one who does not accept the
proper treatment to detach the mind from material engagement can hardly achieve
success in self-realization. Trying to practice yoga while engaging the mind in
material enjoyment is like trying to ignite a fire while pouring water on it.
Similarly, yoga practice without mental control is a waste of time. Such a show
of yoga practice may be materially lucrative, but it is useless as far as
spiritual realization is concerned. Therefore, the mind must be controlled by
engaging it constantly in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. Unless
one is engaged in Kåñëa consciousness, he cannot steadily control the mind. A
Kåñëa conscious person easily achieves the result of yoga practice without
separate endeavor, but a yoga practitioner cannot achieve success without
becoming Kåñëa conscious.

TRANSLATION
Arjuna said: What is the destination of the man of faith who does not persevere,
who in the beginning takes to the process of self-realization but who later
desists due to worldly-mindedness and thus does not attain perfection in
mysticism?

PURPORT
The path of self-realization or mysticism is described in the Bhagavad-gétä. The
basic principle of self-realization is knowledge that the living entity is not
this material body but that he is different from it and that his happiness is in
eternal life, bliss and knowledge. These are transcendental, beyond both body
and mind. Self-realization is sought by the path of knowledge, the practice of
the eightfold system or by bhakti-yoga. In each of these processes one has to
realize the constitutional position of the living entity, his relationship with
God, and the activities whereby he can reestablish the lost link and achieve the
highest perfectional stage of Kåñëa consciousness. Following any of the
above-mentioned three methods, one is sure to reach the supreme goal sooner or
later. This was asserted by the Lord in the Second Chapter: even a little
endeavor on the transcendental path offers a great hope for deliverance. Out of
these three methods, the path of bhakti-yoga is especially suitable for this age
because it is the most direct method of God realization. To be doubly assured,
Arjuna is asking Lord Kåñëa to confirm His former statement. One may sincerely
accept the path of self-realization, but the process of cultivation of knowledge
and the practice of the eightfold yoga system are generally very difficult for
this age. Therefore, despite constant endeavor, one may fail for many reasons.
First of all, one may not be following the process. To pursue the transcendental
path is more or less to declare war on illusory energy. Consequently, whenever a
person tries to escape the clutches of the illusory energy, she tries to defeat
the practitioner by various allurements. A conditioned soul is already allured
by the modes of material energy, and there is every chance of being allured
again, even while performing transcendental disciplines. This is called yogät
calita-mänasaù: deviation from the transcendental path. Arjuna is inquisitive to
know the results of deviation from the path of self-realization.

TRANSLATION
O mighty-armed Kåñëa, does not such a man, being deviated from the path of
Transcendence, perish like a riven cloud, with no position in any sphere?

PURPORT
There are two ways to progress. Those who are materialists have no interest in
Transcendence; therefore they are more interested in material advancement by
economic development, or in promotion to the higher planets by appropriate work.
When one takes to the path of Transcendence, one has to cease all material
activities and sacrifice all forms of so-called material happiness. If the
aspiring transcendentalist fails, then he apparently loses both ways; in other
words, he can enjoy neither material happiness nor spiritual success. He has no
position; he is like a riven cloud. A cloud in the sky sometimes deviates from a
small cloud and joins a big one. But if it cannot join a big one, then it is
blown away by the wind and becomes a nonentity in the vast sky. The brahmaëaù
pathi is the path of transcendental realization through knowing oneself to be
spiritual in essence, part and parcel of the Supreme Lord who is manifested as
Brahman, Paramätmä and Bhagavän. Lord Çré Kåñëa is the fullest manifestation of
the Supreme Absolute Truth, and therefore one who is surrendered to the Supreme
Person is a successful transcendentalist. To reach this goal of life through
Brahman and Paramätmä realization takes many, many births: Bahünäà janmanäm
ante. Therefore the supermost of transcendental realization is bhakti-yoga or
Kåñëa consciousness, the direct method.

TRANSLATION
This is my doubt O Kåñëa, and I ask You to dispel it completely. But for
Yourself, no one is to be found who can destroy this doubt.

PURPORT
Kåñëa is the perfect knower of past, present and future. In the beginning of the
Bhagavad-gétä, the Lord said that all living entities exist individually in the
past, that they exist now in the present, and that they continue to retain
individual identity in the future, even after liberation from the material
entanglement. So He has already cleared up the question of the future of the
individual living entity. Now, Arjuna wants to know of the future of the
unsuccessful transcendentalist. No one is equal to or above Kåñëa, and certainly
the so-called great sages and philosophers who are at the mercy of material
nature cannot equal Him. Therefore the verdict of Kåñëa is the final and
complete answer to all doubts because He knows past, present and future
perfectly—but no one knows Him. Kåñëa and Kåñëa conscious devotees alone can
know what is what.

The Blessed Lord said: Son of Påthä, a transcendentalist engaged in auspicious

PURPORT
In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam (1.5.17) Çré Närada Muni instructs Vyäsadeva as
follows:

tyaktvä sva-dharmaà caraëämbujaà harer
bhajann apakko ’tha patet tato yadi
yatra kva väbhadram abhüd amuñya kià
ko värtha äpto ’bhajatäà sva-dharmataù

"If someone gives up all material prospects and takes complete shelter of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, there is no loss or degradation in any way. On
the other hand a nondevotee may fully engage in his occupational duties and yet
not gain anything." For material prospects, there are many activities both
scriptural and customary. A transcendentalist is supposed to give up all
material activities for the sake of spiritual advancement in life, Kåñëa
consciousness. One may argue that by Kåñëa consciousness one may attain the
highest perfection if it is completed, but if one does not attain such a
perfectional stage, then he loses both materially and spiritually. It is
enjoined in the scriptures that one has to suffer the reaction of not executing
prescribed duties; therefore one who fails to discharge transcendental
activities properly becomes subjected to these reactions. The Bhägavatam assures
the unsuccessful transcendentalist that there need be no worries. Even though he
may be subjected to the reaction of not perfectly executing prescribed duties,
he is still not a loser, because auspicious Kåñëa consciousness is never
forgotten, and one so engaged will continue to be so even if he is lowborn in
the next life. On the other hand, one who simply follows strictly the prescribed
duties need not necessarily attain auspicious results if he is lacking in Kåñëa
consciousness.

The purport may be understood as follows: humanity may be divided into two
sections, namely, the regulated and the nonregulated. Those who are engaged
simply in bestial sense gratifications without knowledge of their next life or
spiritual salvation belong to the nonregulated section. And those who follow the
principles of prescribed duties in the scriptures are classified amongst the
regulated section. The nonregulated section, both civilized and noncivilized,
educated and noneducated, strong and weak, are full of animal propensities.
Their activities are never auspicious because, enjoying the animal propensities
of eating, sleeping, defending and mating, they perpetually remain in material
existence, which is always miserable. On the other hand, those who are regulated
by scriptural injunctions and thus gradually rise to Kåñëa consciousness
certainly progress in life.

Those who are then following the path of auspiciousness can be divided into
three sections, namely, 1) the followers of scriptural rules and regulations who
are enjoying material prosperity, 2) those who are trying to find out the
ultimate liberation from material existence, and 3) those who are devotees in
Kåñëa consciousness. Those who are following the rules and regulations of the
scriptures for material happiness may be further divided into two classes: those
who are fruitive workers and those who desire no fruit for sense gratification.
Those who are after fruitive results for sense gratification may be elevated to
a higher standard of life—even to the higher planets; but still, because they
are not free from material existence, they are not following the truly
auspicious path. The only auspicious activities are those which lead one to
liberation. Any activity which is not aimed at ultimate self-realization or
liberation from the material bodily concept of life is not at all auspicious.
Activity in Kåñëa consciousness is the only auspicious activity, and anyone who
voluntarily accepts all bodily discomforts for the sake of making progress on
the path of Kåñëa consciousness can be called a perfect transcendentalist under
severe austerity. And because the eightfold yoga system is directed toward the
ultimate realization of Kåñëa consciousness, such practice is also auspicious,
and no one who is trying his best in this matter need fear degradation.

TRANSLATION
The unsuccessful yogé, after many, many years of enjoyment on the planets of the
pious living entities, is born into a family of righteous people, or into a
family of rich aristocracy.

PURPORT
The unsuccessful yogés are divided into two classes: one is fallen after very
little progress, and one is fallen after long practice of yoga. The yogé who
falls after a short period of practice goes to the higher planets where pious
living entities are allowed to enter. After prolonged life there, he is sent
back again to this planet, to take birth in the family of a righteous brähmaëa
vaiñëava or of aristocratic merchants.

The real purpose of yoga practice is to achieve the highest perfection of Kåñëa
consciousness. But those who do not persevere to such an extent and fail due to
material allurements are allowed, by the grace of the Lord, to make full
utilization of their material propensities. And after that, they are given
opportunities to live prosperous lives in righteous or aristocratic families.
Those who are born in such families may take advantage of the facilities and try
to elevate themselves to full Kåñëa consciousness.

Or he takes his birth in a family of transcendentalists who are surely great in

PURPORT
Birth in a family of yogés or transcendentalists—those with great wisdom—is
praised herein because the child born in such a family receives spiritual
impetus from the very beginning of his life. It is especially the case in the
äcärya or gosvämé families. Such families are very learned and devoted by
tradition and training, and thus they become spiritual masters. In India there
are many such äcärya families, but they have now degenerated due to insufficient
education and training. By the grace of the Lord, there are still families that
foster transcendentalists generation after generation. It is certainly very
fortunate to take birth in such families. Fortunately, both our spiritual
master, Oà Viñëupäda Çré Çrémad Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Gosvämé Mahäräja, and
our humble self, had the opportunity to take birth in such families, by the
grace of the Lord, and both of us were trained in the devotional service of the
Lord from the very beginning of our lives. Later on we met by the order of the
transcendental system.

PURPORT
King Bharata, who took his third birth in the family of a good brähmaëa, is an
example of good birth for the revival of previous transcendental consciousness.
King Bharata was the Emperor of the world, and since his time this planet is
known among the demigods as Bhäratavarña. Formerly it was known as
Ilävartavarña. The Emperor, at an early age, retired for spiritual perfection
but failed to achieve success. In his next life he took birth in the family of a
good brähmaëa and was known as Jaòabharata because he always remained secluded
and did not talk to anyone. And later on, he was discovered as the greatest
transcendentalist by King Rahügaëa. From his life it is understood that
transcendental endeavors, or the practice of yoga, never go in vain. By the
grace of the Lord the transcendentalist gets repeated opportunities for complete
perfection in Kåñëa consciousness.

By virtue of the divine consciousness of his previous life, he automatically

inquisitive transcendentalist, striving for yoga, stands always above the
ritualistic principles of the scriptures.

PURPORT
Advanced yogés are not very much attracted to the rituals of the scriptures, but
they automatically become attracted to the yoga principles, which can elevate
them to complete Kåñëa consciousness, the highest yoga perfection. In the
Çrémad-Bhägavatam (3.33.8), such disregard of Vedic rituals by the advanced
transcendentalists is explained as follows:

aho bata çvapaco ’to garéyän
yajjihvägre vartate näma tubhyam
tepus tapas te juhuvuù sasnur äryä
brahmänücur näma gåëanti ye te.

"O my Lord! Persons who chant the holy names of Your Lordship are far, far
advanced in spiritual life, even if born in families of dog-eaters. Such
chanters have undoubtedly performed all kinds of austerities and sacrifices,
bathed in all sacred places, and finished all scriptural studies."

The famous example of this was presented by Lord Caitanya, who accepted Öhäkur
Haridäsa as one of His most important disciples. Although Öhäkur Haridäsa
happened to take his birth in a Moslem family, he was elevated to the post of
nämäcärya by Lord Caitanya due to his rigidly attended principle of chanting
three hundred thousand holy names of the Lord daily: Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa,
Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare. And because
he chanted the holy name of the Lord constantly, it is understood that in his
previous life he must have passed through all the ritualistic methods of the
Vedas, known as çabda-brahman. Unless, therefore, one is purified, one cannot
take to the principle of Kåñëa consciousness nor become engaged in chanting the
holy name of the Lord, Hare Kåñëa.

TRANSLATION
But when the yogé engages himself with sincere endeavor in making further
progress, being washed of all contaminations, then ultimately, after many, many
births of practice, he attains the supreme goal.

PURPORT
A person born in a particularly righteous, aristocratic or sacred family becomes
conscious of his favorable condition for executing yoga practice. With
determination, therefore, he begins his unfinished task, and thus he completely
cleanses himself of all material contaminations. When he is finally free from
all contaminations, he attains the supreme perfection—Kåñëa consciousness. Kåñëa
consciousness is the perfect stage of being freed of all contaminations. This is
confirmed in the Bhagavad-gétä:

yeñäà tvanta-gataà päpaà janänäà puëya-karmaëäm
te dvandva-moha-nirmuktä bhajante mäà dåòha-vratäù

"After many, many births of executing pious activities, when one is completely
freed from all contaminations, and from all illusory dualities, one then becomes
engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord."

TRANSLATION
A yogé is greater than the ascetic, greater than the empiricist and greater than
the fruitive worker. Therefore, O Arjuna, in all circumstances, be a yogé.

PURPORT
When we speak of yoga we refer to linking up our consciousness with the Supreme
Absolute Truth. Such a process is named differently by various practitioners in
terms of the particular method adopted. When the linking up process is
predominantly in fruitive activities, it is called karma-yoga, when it is
predominantly empirical, it is called jïäna-yoga, and when it is predominantly
in a devotional relationship with the Supreme Lord, it is called bhakti-yoga.
Bhakti-yoga or Kåñëa consciousness is the ultimate perfection of all yogas, as
will be explained in the next verse. The Lord has confirmed herein the
superiority of yoga, but He has not mentioned that it is better than
bhakti-yoga. Bhakti-yoga is full spiritual knowledge, and as such, nothing can
excel it. Asceticism without self-knowledge is imperfect. Empiric knowledge
without surrender to the Supreme Lord is also imperfect. And fruitive work
without Kåñëa consciousness is a waste of time. Therefore, the most highly
praised form of yoga performance mentioned here is bhakti-yoga, and this is
still more clearly explained in the next verse.

TRANSLATION
And of all yogés, he who always abides in Me with great faith, worshiping Me in
transcendental loving service, is most intimately united with Me in yoga and is
the highest of all.

PURPORT
The word bhajete is significant here. Bhajete has its root in the verb bhaj,
which is used when there is need of service. The English word "worship" cannot
be used in the same sense as bhaja. Worship means to adore, or to show respect
and honor to the worthy one. But service with love and faith is especially meant
for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One can avoid worshiping a respectable
man or a demigod and may be called discourteous, but one cannot avoid serving
the Supreme Lord without being thoroughly condemned. Every living entity is part
and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and thus every living entity
is intended to serve the Supreme Lord by his own constitution. Failing to do
this, he falls down. The Bhägavatam confirms this as follows:

ya eñäà puruñaà säkñäd ätma-prabhavam éçvaram
na bhajanty avajänanti sthänäd bhrañöä patanty adhaù.

"Anyone who does not render service and neglects his duty unto the Primeval
Lord, who is the source of all living entities, will certainly fall down from
his constitutional position."

In this verse also the word bhajanti is used. Therefore, bhajanti is applicable
to the Supreme Lord only, whereas the word "worship" can be applied to demigods
or to any other common living entity. The word avajänanti, used in this verse of
Çrémad-Bhägavatam, is also found in the Bhagavad-gétä: avajänanti mäà müòhäù:
"Only the fools and rascals deride the Supreme Personality of Godhead Lord
Kåñëa." Such fools take it upon themselves to write commentaries on the
Bhagavad-gétä without an attitude of service to the Lord. Consequently they
cannot properly distinguish between the word bhajanti and the word "worship."

The culmination of all kinds of yoga practices lies in bhakti-yoga. All other
yogas are but means to come to the point of bhakti in bhakti-yoga. Yoga actually
means bhakti-yoga; all other yogas are progressions toward the destination of
bhakti-yoga. From the beginning of karma-yoga to the end of bhakti-yoga is a
long way to self-realization. Karma-yoga, without fruitive results, is the
beginning of this path. When karma-yoga increases in knowledge and renunciation,
the stage is called jïäna-yoga. When jïäna-yoga increases in meditation on the
Supersoul by different physical processes, and the mind is on Him, it is called
añöäìga-yoga. And, when one surpasses the añöäìga-yoga and comes to the point of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead Kåñëa, it is called bhakti-yoga, the
culmination. Factually, bhakti-yoga is the ultimate goal, but to analyze
bhakti-yoga minutely one has to understand these other yogas. The yogé who is
progressive is therefore on the true path of eternal good fortune. One who
sticks to a particular point and does not make further progress is called by
that particular name: karma-yogé, jïäna-yogé or dhyäna-yogé, räja-yogé,
haöha-yogé, etc. If one is fortunate enough to come to the point of bhakti-yoga,
it is to be understood that he has surpassed all the other yogas. Therefore, to
become Kåñëa conscious is the highest stage of yoga, just as, when we speak of
Himalayan, we refer to the world’s highest mountains, of which the highest peak,
Mount Everest, is considered to be the culmination.

It is by great fortune that one comes to Kåñëa consciousness on the path of
bhakti-yoga to become well situated according to the Vedic direction. The ideal
yogé concentrates his attention on Kåñëa, who is called Çyämasundara, who is as
beautifully colored as a cloud, whose lotus-like face is as effulgent as the
sun, whose dress is brilliant with jewels and whose body is flower garlanded.
Illuminating all sides is His gorgeous luster, which is called the brahmajyoti.
He incarnates in different forms such as Räma, Nåsiàha, Varäha and Kåñëa, the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He descends like a human being, as the son
of Mother Yaçodä, and He is known as Kåñëa, Govinda and Väsudeva. He is the
perfect child, husband, friend and master, and He is full with all opulences and
transcendental qualities. If one remains fully conscious of these features of
the Lord, he is called the highest yogé.

This stage of highest perfection in yoga can be attained only by bhakti-yoga, as
is confirmed in all Vedic literature:

yasya deve parä bhaktir yathä deve tathä gurau.
tasyaite kathitä hy arthäù prakäçante mahätmanaù.

"Only unto those great souls who have implicit faith in both the Lord and the
spiritual master are all the imports of Vedic knowledge automatically revealed."

Bhaktir asya bhajanaà tadihämutropädhi nairäsyenämuñmin manaù kalpanam; etad eva
naiñkarmyam. “Bhakti means devotional service to the Lord which is free from
desire for material profit, either in this life or in the next. Devoid of such
inclinations, one should fully absorb the mind in the Supreme. That is the
purpose of naiñkarmya.”

These are some of the means for performance of bhakti or Kåñëa consciousness,
the highest perfectional stage of the yoga system.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Sixth Chapter of the
Çrémad-Bhagavad-gétä in the matter of Säìkhya-yoga Brahma-vidyä.

Knowledge of the Absolute

TRANSLATION
Now hear, O son of Påthä [Arjuna], how by practicing yoga in full consciousness
of Me, with mind attached to Me, you can know Me in full, free from doubt.

PURPORT
In this Seventh Chapter of Bhagavad-gétä, the nature of Kåñëa consciousness is
fully described. Kåñëa is full in all opulences, and how He manifests such
opulences is described herein. Also, four kinds of fortunate people who become
attached to Kåñëa, and four kinds of unfortunate people who never take to Kåñëa
are described in this chapter.

In the first six chapters of Bhagavad-gétä, the living entity has been described
as nonmaterial spirit soul which is capable of elevating himself to
self-realization by different types of yogas. At the end of the Sixth Chapter,
it has been clearly stated that the steady concentration of the mind upon Kåñëa,
or in other words Kåñëa consciousness, is the highest form of all yoga. By
concentrating one’s mind upon Kåñëa, one is able to know the Absolute Truth
completely, but not otherwise. Impersonal brahmajyoti or localized Paramätmä
realization is not perfect knowledge of the Absolute Truth because it is
partial. Full and scientific knowledge is Kåñëa, and everything is revealed to
the person in Kåñëa consciousness. In complete Kåñëa consciousness one knows
that Kåñëa is ultimate knowledge beyond any doubts. Different types of yoga are
only steppingstones on the path of Kåñëa consciousness. One who takes directly
to Kåñëa consciousness automatically knows about brahmajyoti and Paramätmä in
full. By practice of Kåñëa consciousness yoga, one can know everything in
full—namely the Absolute Truth, the living entities, the material nature, and
their manifestations with paraphernalia.

One should therefore begin yoga practice as directed in the last verse of the
Sixth Chapter. Concentration of the mind upon Kåñëa the Supreme is made possible
by prescribed devotional service in nine different forms, of which çravaëam is
the first and most important. The Lord therefore says to Arjuna, "tat çåëu," or
"Hear from Me." No one can be a greater authority than Kåñëa, and therefore by
hearing from Him one receives the greatest opportunity for progress in Kåñëa
consciousness. One has therefore to learn from Kåñëa directly or from a pure
devotee of Kåñëa—and not from a nondevotee upstart, puffed up with academic
education.

In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam this process of understanding Kåñëa, the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, is described in the Second Chapter
of the First Canto as follows:

çåëvatäà sva-kathäà kåñëaù puëya-çravaëa-kértanaù
hådyantaùstho hy abhadräëi vidbunoti suhåt satäm.

nañöa-präyeñv abhadreñu nityaà bhägavata-sevayä
bhagavaty uttama-çloke bhaktir bhavati naiñöhiké.

tadä rajas-tamo-bhäväù käma-lobhadayaç ca ye
ceta etair anäviddhaà sthitaà sattve prasédati.

evam prasanna-manaso bhagavad-bhakti-yogataù
bhagavat-tattva-vijïänaà mukta-saìgasya jäyate.

bhidyate hådaya-granthiç chidyante sarva-saàçayäù
kñéyante cäsya karmäëi dåñöa evätmanéçvare.

"To hear about Kåñëa from Vedic literatures, or to hear from Him directly
through the Bhagavad-gétä, is itself righteous activity. And for one who hears
about Kåñëa, Lord Kåñëa, who is dwelling in everyone’s heart, acts as a
best-wishing friend and purifies the devotee who constantly engages in hearing
of Him. In this way, a devotee naturally develops his dormant transcendental
knowledge. As he hears more about Kåñëa from the Bhägavatam and from the
devotees, he becomes fixed in the devotional service of the Lord. By development
of devotional service one becomes freed from the modes of passion and ignorance,
and thus material lusts and avarice are diminished. When these impurities are
wiped away, the candidate remains steady in his position of pure goodness,
becomes enlivened by devotional service and understands the science of God
perfectly. Thus bhakti-yoga severs the hard knot of material affection and
enables one to come at once to the stage of ‘asaàçayaà samagram,’ understanding
of the Supreme Absolute Truth Personality of Godhead." (Bhäg. 1.2.17–21)

Therefore only by hearing from Kåñëa or from His devotee in Kåñëa consciousness
can one understand the science of Kåñëa.

TRANSLATION
I shall now declare unto you in full this knowledge both phenomenal and
noumenal, by knowing which there shall remain nothing further to be known.

PURPORT
Complete knowledge includes knowledge of the phenomenal world and the spirit
behind it. The source of both of them is transcendental knowledge. The Lord
wants to explain the above-mentioned system of knowledge because Arjuna is
Kåñëa’s confidential devotee and friend. In the beginning of the Fourth Chapter
this explanation was given by the Lord, and it is again confirmed here: complete
knowledge can be achieved only by the devotee of the Lord directly from the Lord
in disciplic succession. Therefore one should be intelligent enough to know the
source of all knowledge, who is the cause of all causes and the only object for
meditation in all types of yoga practices. When the cause of all causes becomes
known, then everything knowable becomes known, and nothing remains unknown. The
Vedas say, “yasmin vijïäte sarvam eva vijïatam bhavanti.”

TRANSLATION
Out of many thousands among men, one may endeavor for perfection, and of those
who have achieved perfection, hardly one knows Me in truth.

PURPORT
There are various grades of men, and out of many thousands one may be
sufficiently interested in transcendental realization to try to know what is the
self, what is the body, and what is the Absolute Truth. Generally mankind is
simply engaged in the animal propensities, namely eating, sleeping, defending
and mating, and hardly anyone is interested in transcendental knowledge. The
first six chapters of the Gétä are meant for those who are interested in
transcendental knowledge, in understanding the self, the Superself and the
process of realization by jïäna-yoga, dhyäna-yoga, and discrimination of the
self from matter. However, Kåñëa can only be known by persons who are in Kåñëa
consciousness. Other transcendentalists may achieve impersonal Brahman
realization, for this is easier than understanding Kåñëa. Kåñëa is the Supreme
Person, but at the same time He is beyond the knowledge of Brahman and
Paramätmä. The yogés and jïänés are confused in their attempts to understand
Kåñëa, although the greatest of the impersonalists, Çrépäda Çaìkaräcärya, has
admitted in his Gétä commentary that Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. But his followers do not accept Kåñëa as such, for it is very difficult
to know Kåñëa, even though one has transcendental realization of impersonal
Brahman.

Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the cause of all causes, the
primeval Lord Govinda. Éçvaraù paramaù kåñëaù sac-cid-änanda-vigrahaù anädir
ädir govindaù sarva-käraëa-käraëam. It is very difficult for the nondevotees to
know Him. Although nondevotees declare that the path of bhakti or devotional
service is very easy, they cannot practice it. If the path of bhakti is so easy,
as the nondevotee class of men proclaim, then why do they take up the difficult
path? Actually the path of bhakti is not easy. The so-called path of bhakti
practiced by unauthorized persons without knowledge of bhakti may be easy, but
when it is practiced factually according to the rules and regulations, the
speculative scholars and philosophers fall away from the path. Çréla Rüpa
Gosvämé writes in his Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu:

çruti-småti-puräëädi-païcarätra-vidhià vinä
aikäntiké harer bhaktir utpätäyaiva kalpate.

"Devotional service of the Lord that ignores the authorized Vedic literatures
like the Upaniñads, Puräëas, Närada-païcarätra, etc., is simply an unnecessary
disturbance in society."

It is not possible for the Brahman realized impersonalist or the Paramätmä
realized yogé to understand Kåñëa the Supreme Personality of Godhead as the son
of mother Yaçodä or the charioteer of Arjuna. Even the great demigods are
sometimes confused about Kåñëa: “muhyanti yat sürayaù,” “mäà tu veda na
kaçcana.” “No one knows Me as I am,” the Lord says. And if one does know Him,
then “sa mahätmä sudurlabhaù.” “Such a great soul is very rare.” Therefore
unless one practices devotional service to the Lord, he cannot know Kåñëa as He
is (tattvataù), even though one is a great scholar or philosopher. Only the pure
devotees can know something of the inconceivable transcendental qualities in
Kåñëa, in the cause of all causes, in His omnipotence and opulence, and in His
wealth, fame, strength, beauty, knowledge and renunciation, because Kåñëa is
benevolently inclined to His devotees. He is the last word in Brahman
realization, and the devotees alone can realize Him as He is. Therefore it is
said:

ataù çré-kåñëa-nämädi na bhaved grähyam indriyäiù
sevonmukhe hi jihvädau svayam eva sphuraty adaù

"No one can understand Kåñëa as He is by the blunt material senses. But He
reveals Himself to the devotees, being pleased with them for their
transcendental loving service unto Him." (Padma Puräëa)

TRANSLATION
Earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego—altogether
these eight comprise My separated material energies.

PURPORT
The science of God analyzes the constitutional position of God and His diverse
energies. Material nature is called prakåti, or the energy of the Lord in His
different puruña incarnations (expansions) as described in the Svatvata Tantra:

viñëos tu tréëi rüpäëi puruñäkhyäny atho viduù
ekantu mahataù srañöå dvitéyaà tv aëòa-saàsthitam
tåtéyaà sarvabhüta-sthaà täni jïätvä vimucyate

"For material creation, Lord Kåñëa’s plenary expansion assumes three Viñëus. The
first one, Mahä-Viñëu, creates the total material energy, known as mahat-tattva.
The second, Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu, enters into all the universes to create
diversities in each of them. The third, Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu, is diffused as the
all-pervading Supersoul in all the universes and is known as Paramätmä, who is
present even within the atoms. Anyone who knows these three Viñëus can be
liberated from material entanglement."

This material world is a temporary manifestation of one of the energies of the
Lord. All the activities of the material world are directed by these three Viñëu
expansions of Lord Kåñëa. These Puruñas are called incarnations. Generally one
who does not know the science of God (Kåñëa) assumes that this material world is
for the enjoyment of the living entities and that the living entities are the
causes (Puruñas), controllers and enjoyers of the material energy. According to
Bhagavad-gétä this atheistic conclusion is false. In the verse under discussion
it is stated that Kåñëa is the original cause of the material manifestation.
Çrémad-Bhägavatam also confirms this. The ingredients of the material
manifestation are separated energies of the Lord. Even the brahmajyoti, which is
the ultimate goal of the impersonalists, is a spiritual energy manifested in the
spiritual sky. There are no spiritual diversities in brahmajyoti as there are in
the Vaikuëöhalokas, and the impersonalist accepts this brahmajyoti as the
ultimate eternal goal. The Paramätmä manifestation is also a temporary
all-pervasive aspect of the Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu. The Paramätmä manifestation is
not eternal in the spiritual world. Therefore the factual Absolute Truth is the
Supreme Personality of Godhead Kåñëa. He is the complete energetic person, and
He possesses different separated and internal energies.

In the material energy, the principal manifestations are eight, as above
mentioned. Out of these, the first five manifestations, namely earth, water,
fire, air and sky, are called the five gigantic creations or the gross
creations, within which the five sense objects are included. They are the
manifestations of physical sound, touch, form, taste and smell. Material science
comprises these ten items and nothing more. But the other three items, namely
mind, intelligence and false ego, are neglected by the materialists.
Philosophers who deal with mental activities are also not perfect in knowledge
because they do not know the ultimate source, Kåñëa. The false ego—"I am," and
"It is mine," which constitute the basic principle of material
existence—includes ten sense organs for material activities. Intelligence refers
to the total material creation, called the mahat-tattva. Therefore from the
eight separated energies of the Lord are manifest the twenty-four elements of
the material world, which are the subject matter of säìkhya atheistic
philosophy; they are originally offshoots from Kåñëa’s energies and are
separated from Him, but atheistic säìkhya philosophers with a poor fund of
knowledge do not know Kåñëa as the cause of all causes. The subject matter for
discussion in the säìkhya philosophy is only the manifestation of the external
energy of Kåñëa, as it is described in the Bhagavad-gétä.

TRANSLATION
Besides this inferior nature, O mighty-armed Arjuna, there is a superior energy
of Mine, which are all living entities who are struggling with material nature
and are sustaining the universe.

PURPORT
Here it is clearly mentioned that living entities belong to the superior nature
(or energy) of the Supreme Lord. The inferior energy is matter manifested in
different elements, namely earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence
and false ego. Both forms of material nature, namely gross (earth, etc.) and
subtle (mind, etc.), are products of the inferior energy. The living entities,
who are exploiting these inferior energies for different purposes, are the
superior energy of the Supreme Lord, and it is due to this energy that the
entire material world functions. The cosmic manifestation has no power to act
unless it is moved by the superior energy, the living entity. Energies are
always controlled by the energetic, and therefore living entities are always
controlled by the Lord—they have no independant existence. They are never
equally powerful, as unintelligent men think. The distinction between the living
entities and the Lord is described in Çrémad-Bhägavatam as follows (10.87.30):

aparimitä dhruväs tanubhåto yadi sarva-gatäs
tarhià na çäsyateti niyamo dhruva netarathä
ajani ca yanmayaà tad avimucya niyantå
bhavet samam anujänatäà yad-amataà mata-duñöatayä

"O Supreme Eternal! If the embodied living entities were eternal and
all-pervading like You, then they would not be under Your control. But if the
living entities are accepted as minute energies of Your Lordship, then they are
at once subject to Your supreme control. Therefore real liberation entails
surrender by the living entities to Your control, and that surrender will make
them happy. In that constitutional position only can they be controllers.
Therefore, men with limited knowledge who advocate the monistic theory that God
and the living entities are equal in all respects are actually misleading
themselves and others."

The Supreme Lord Kåñëa is the only controller, and all living entities are
controlled by Him. These living entities are His superior energy because the
quality of their existence is one and the same with the Supreme, but they are
never equal to the Lord in quantity of power. While exploiting the gross and
subtle inferior energy (matter), the superior energy (the living entity) forgets
his real spiritual mind and intelligence. This forgetfulness is due to the
influence of matter upon the living entity. But when the living entity becomes
free from the influence of the illusory material energy, he attains the stage
called mukti, or liberation. The false ego, under the influence of material
illusion, thinks, "I am matter, and material acquisitions are mine." His actual
position is realized when he is liberated from all material ideas, including the
conception of his becoming one in all respects with God. Therefore one may
conclude that the Gétä confirms the living entity to be only one of the
multi-energies of Kåñëa; and when this energy is freed from material
contamination, it becomes fully Kåñëa conscious, or liberated.

Of all that is material and all that is spiritual in this world, know for

PURPORT
Everything that exists is a product of matter and spirit. Spirit is the basic
field of creation, and matter is created by spirit. Spirit is not created at a
certain stage of material development. Rather, this material world is manifested
only on the basis of spiritual energy. This material body is developed because
spirit is present within matter; a child grows gradually to boyhood and then to
manhood because of that superior energy, spirit soul, being present. Similarly,
the entire cosmic manifestation of the gigantic universe is developed because of
the presence of the Supersoul, Viñëu. Therefore spirit and matter, which combine
together to manifest this gigantic universal form, are originally two energies
of the Lord, and consequently the Lord is the original cause of everything. A
fragmental part and parcel of the Lord, namely, the living entity, may by
manipulation of material energy construct a skyscraper, factory or city, but he
cannot create matter out of nothing, and he certainly cannot construct a planet
or a universe. The cause of the universe is the Supersoul, Kåñëa, the supreme
creator of all individual souls and the original cause of all causes, as the
Kaöha Upaniñad confirms: nityo nityänäà cetanaç cetanänäm.

TRANSLATION
O conquerer of wealth [Arjuna], there is no Truth superior to Me. Everything
rests upon Me, as pearls are strung on a thread.

PURPORT
There is a common controversy over whether the Supreme Absolute Truth is
personal or impersonal. As far as Bhagavad-gétä is concerned, the Absolute Truth
is the Personality of Godhead Çré Kåñëa, and this is confirmed in every step. In
this verse, in particular, it is stressed that the Absolute Truth is a person.
That the Personality of Godhead is the Supreme Absolute Truth is also the
affirmation of the Brahma-saàhitä: éçvaraù paramaù kåñëaù
sac-cid-änanda-vigrahaù; that is, the Supreme Absolute Truth Personality of
Godhead is Lord Kåñëa, who is the primeval Lord, the reservoir of all pleasure,
Govinda, and the eternal form of complete bliss and knowledge. These authorities
leave no doubt that the Absolute Truth is the Supreme Person, the cause of all
causes. The impersonalist, however, argues on the strength of the Vedic version
given in the Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad: tato yad uttarataraà tad arüpam anämayaà ya
etad vidur amåtäs te bhavanti athetare duùkham eväpi yanti. "In the material
world Brahmä, the primeval living entity within the universe, is understood to
be the supreme amongst the demigods, human beings and lower animals. But beyond
Brahmä there is the Transcendence who has no material form and is free from all
material contaminations. Anyone who can know Him also becomes transcendental,
but those who do not know Him suffer the miseries of the material world."

The impersonalist puts more stress on the word arüpam. But this arüpam is not
impersonal. It indicates the transcendental form of eternity, bliss and
knowledge as described in the Brahma-saàhitä quoted above. Other verses in the
Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad substantiate this as follows:

vedäham etaà puruñaà mahäntam äditya-varëaà tamasaù parastät
tam eva vidvän amåta iha bhavati nänyaù panthä vidyate ayanäya
yasmät paraà näparam asti kiïcid yasmännäëéyo na jyäyo ’sti kiïcit

"I know that Supreme Personality of Godhead who is transcendental to all
material conceptions of darkness. Only he who knows Him can transcend the bonds
of birth and death. There is no way for liberation other than this knowledge of
that Supreme Person.

"There is no truth superior to that Supreme Person because He is the supermost.
He is smaller than the smallest, and He is greater than the greatest. He is
situated as a silent tree, and He illumines the transcendental sky, and as a
tree spreads its roots, He spreads His extensive energies."

From these verses one concludes that the Supreme Absolute Truth is the Supreme
Personality of Godhead who is all-pervading by His multi-energies, both material
and spiritual.

moon, the syllable om in the Vedic mantras; I am the sound in ether and ability
in man.

PURPORT
This verse explains how the Lord is all-pervasive by His diverse material and
spiritual energies. The Supreme Lord can be preliminarily perceived by His
different energies, and in this way He is realized impersonally. As the demigod
in the sun is a person and is perceived by his all-pervading energy, the
sunshine, similarly, the Lord, although in His eternal abode, is perceived by
His all-pervading, diffusive energies. The taste of water is the active
principle of water. No one likes to drink sea water because the pure taste of
water is mixed with salt. Attraction for water depends on the purity of the
taste, and this pure taste is one of the energies of the Lord. The impersonalist
perceives the presence of the Lord in water by its taste, and the personalist
also glorifies the Lord for His kindly supplying water to quench man’s thirst.
That is the way of perceiving the Supreme. Practically speaking, there is no
conflict between personalism and impersonalism. One who knows God knows that the
impersonal conception and personal conception are simultaneously present in
everything and that there is no contradiction. Therefore Lord Caitanya
established His sublime doctrine: acintya-bheda and
abheda-tattvam—simultaneously one and different.

The light of the sun and the moon is also originally emanating from the
brahmajyoti, which is the impersonal effulgence of the Lord. Similarly praëava
or the omkära transcendental sound used in the beginning of every Vedic hymn to
address the Supreme Lord also emanates from Him. Because the impersonalists are
very much afraid of addressing the Supreme Lord Kåñëa by His innumerable names,
they prefer to vibrate the transcendental sound omkära. But they do not realize
that omkära is the sound representation of Kåñëa. The jurisdiction of Kåñëa
consciousness extends everywhere, and one who knows Kåñëa consciousness is
blessed. Those who do not know Kåñëa are in illusion, and so knowledge of Kåñëa
is liberation, and ignorance of Him is bondage.

TRANSLATION
I am the original fragrance of the earth, and I am the heat in fire. I am the
life of all that lives, and I am the penances of all ascetics.

PURPORT
Puëya means that which is not decomposed; puëya is original. Everything in the
material world has a certain flavor or fragrance, as the flavor and fragrance in
a flower, or in the earth, in water, in fire, in air, etc. The uncontaminated
flavor, the original flavor, which permeates everything, is Kåñëa. Similarly,
everything has a particular original taste, and this taste can be changed by the
mixture of chemicals. So everything original has some smell, some fragrance, and
some taste. Vibhäva means fire. Without fire we cannot run factories, we cannot
cook, etc., and that fire is Kåñëa. The heat in the fire is Kåñëa. According to
Vedic medicine, indigestion is due to a low temperature in the belly. So even
for digestion fire is needed. In Kåñëa consciousness we become aware that earth,
water, fire, air and every active principle, all chemicals and all material
elements are due to Kåñëa. The duration of man’s life is also due to Kåñëa.
Therefore by the grace of Kåñëa, man can prolong his life or diminish it. So
Kåñëa consciousness is active in every sphere.

understand; pärtha—O son of Påthä; sanätanam—original, eternal;
buddhiù—intelligence; buddhimatäm—of the intelligent; asmi—I am; tejaù—prowess;
tejasvinäm—of the powerful; aham—I am.

TRANSLATION
O son of Påthä, know that I am the original seed of all existences, the
intelligence of the intelligent, and the prowess of all powerful men.

PURPORT
Béjam means seed; Kåñëa is the seed of everything. In contact with material
nature, the seed fructifies into various living entities, movable and inert.
Birds, beasts, men and many other living creatures are moving living entities;
trees and plants, however, are inert—they cannot move, but only stand. Every
entity is contained within the scope of 8,400,000 species of life; some of them
are moving and some of them are inert. In all cases, however, the seed of their
life is Kåñëa. As stated in Vedic literature, Brahman, or the Supreme Absolute
Truth, is that from which everything is emanating. Kåñëa is Parabrahman, the
Supreme Spirit. Brahman is impersonal and Parabrahman is personal. Impersonal
Brahman is situated in the personal aspect—that is stated in Bhagavad-gétä.
Therefore, originally, Kåñëa is the source of everything. He is the root. As the
root of a tree maintains the whole tree, Kåñëa, being the original root of all
things, maintains everything in this material manifestation. This is also
confirmed in the Vedic literature. Yato vä imäni bhütäni jäyante. "The Supreme
Absolute Truth is that from which everything is born." He is the prime eternal
among all eternals. He is the supreme living entity of all living entities, and
He alone is maintaining all life. Kåñëa also says that He is the root of all
intelligence. Unless a person is intelligent he cannot understand the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa.

TRANSLATION
I am the strength of the strong, devoid of passion and desire. I am sex life
which is not contrary to religious principles, O Lord of the Bhäratas [Arjuna].

PURPORT
The strong man’s strength should be applied to protect the weak, not for
personal aggression. Similarly, sex life, according to religious principles
(dharma), should be for the propagation of children, not otherwise. The
responsibility of parents is then to make their offspring Kåñëa conscious.

TRANSLATION
All states of being—be they of goodness, passion or ignorance—are manifested by
My energy. I am, in one sense, everything—but I am independant. I am not under
the modes of this material nature.

PURPORT
All material activities in the world are being conducted under the three modes
of material nature. Although these material modes of nature are emanations from
the Supreme Lord, Kåñëa, He is not subject to them. For instance, under the
state laws one may be punished, but the king, the lawmaker, is not subject to
that law. Similarly, all the modes of material nature—goodness, passion and
ignorance—are emanations from the Supreme Lord Kåñëa, but Kåñëa is not subject
to material nature. Therefore He is nirguëa, which means that these guëas, or
modes, although issuing from Him, do not affect Him. That is one of the special
characteristics of Bhagavän, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

TRANSLATION
Deluded by the three modes [goodness, passion and ignorance], the whole world
does not know Me who am above the modes and inexhaustible.

PURPORT
The whole world is enchanted by three modes of material nature. Those who are
bewildered by these three modes cannot understand that transcendental to this
material nature is the Supreme Lord, Kåñëa. In this material world everyone is
under the influence of these three guëas and is thus bewildered.

Bv nature living entities have particular types of body and particular types of
psychic and biological activities accordingly. There are four classes of men
functioning in the three material modes of nature. Those who are purely in the
mode of goodness are called brähmaëas. Those who are purely in the mode of
passion are called kñatriyas. Those who are in the modes of both passion and
ignorance are called vaiçyas. Those who are completely in ignorance are called
çüdras. And those who are less than that are animals or animal life. However,
these designations are not permanent. I may either be a brähmaëa, kñatriya,
vaiçya or whatever—in any case, this life is temporary. But although life is
temporary and we do not know what we are going to be in the next life, still, by
the spell of this illusory energy, we consider ourselves in the light of this
bodily conception of life, and we thus think that we are American, Indian,
Russian or brähmaëa, Hindu, Muslim, etc. And if we become entangled with the
modes of material nature, then we forget the Supreme Personality of Godhead who
is behind all these modes. So Lord Kåñëa says that men, deluded by these three
modes of nature, do not understand that behind the material background is the
Supreme Godhead.

There are many different kinds of living entities—human beings, demigods,
animals, etc.—and each and every one of them is under the influence of material
nature, and all of them have forgotten the transcendent Personality of Godhead.
Those who are in the modes of passion and ignorance, and even those who are in
the mode of goodness, cannot go beyond the impersonal Brahman conception of the
Absolute Truth. They are bewildered before the Supreme Lord in His personal
feature, which possesses all beauty, opulence, knowledge, strength, fame and
renunciation. When even those who are in goodness cannot understand, what hope
is there for those in passion and ignorance? Kåñëa consciousness is
transcendental to all these three modes of material nature, and those who are
truly established in Kåñëa consciousness are actually liberated.

modes of material nature; mama—My; mäyä—energy; duratyayä—very difficult to
overcome; mäm—unto Me; eva—certainly; ye—those; prapadyante—surrender; mäyäm

TRANSLATION
This divine energy of Mine, consisting of the three modes of material nature, is
difficult to overcome. But those who have surrendered unto Me can easily cross
beyond it.

PURPORT
The Supreme Personality of Godhead has innumerable energies, and all these
energies are divine. Although the living entities are part of His energies and
are therefore divine, due to contact with material energy, their original
superior power is covered. Being thus covered by material energy, one cannot
possibly overcome its influence. As previously stated, both the material and
spiritual natures, being emanations from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, are
eternal. The living entities belong to the eternal superior nature of the Lord,
but due to contamination by the inferior nature, matter, their illusion is also
eternal. The conditioned soul is therefore called nitya-baddha, or eternally
conditioned. No one can trace out the history of his becoming conditioned at a
certain date in material history. Consequently, his release from the clutches of
material nature is very difficult, even though that material nature is an
inferior energy, because material energy is ultimately conducted by the supreme
will, which the living entity cannot overcome. Inferior material nature is
defined herein as divine nature due to its divine connection and movement by the
divine will. Being conducted by divine will, material nature, although inferior,
acts so wonderfully in the construction and destruction of the cosmic
manifestation. The Vedas confirm this as follows:

mäyäà tu prakåtià vidyän mäyinaà tu maheçvaram.

"Although mäyä [illusion] is false or temporary, the background of mäyä is the
supreme magician, the Personality of Godhead, who is Maheçvara, the supreme
controller."

Another meaning of guëa is rope; it is to be understood that the conditioned
soul is tightly tied by the ropes of illusion. A man bound by the hands and feet
cannot free himself—he must be helped by a person who is unbound. Because the
bound cannot help the bound, the rescuer must be liberated. Therefore, only Lord
Kåñëa, or His bona fide representative the spiritual master, can release the
conditioned soul. Without such superior help, one cannot be freed from the
bondage of material nature. Devotional service, or Kåñëa consciousness, can help
one gain such release. Kåñëa, being the Lord of illusory energy, can order this
insurmountable energy to release the conditioned soul. He orders this release
out of His causeless mercy on the surrendered soul and out of His paternal
affection for the living entity who is originally a beloved son of the Lord.
Therefore surrender unto the lotus feet of the Lord is the only means to get
free from the clutches of the stringent material nature.

The words mäm eva are also significant. Mäm means unto Kåñëa (Viñëu) only, and
not Brahmä or Çiva. Although Brahmä and Çiva are greatly elevated and are almost
on the level of Viñëu, it is not possible for such incarnations of räjo-guëa
(passion) and tamo-guëa (ignorance) to release the conditioned soul from the
clutches of mäyä. In other words, both Brahmä and Çiva are also under the
influence of mäyä. Only Viñëu is the master of mäyä; therefore He can alone give
release to the conditioned soul. The Vedas confirm this in the phrase tvam eva
viditvä or "Freedom is possible only by understanding Kåñëa." Even Lord Çiva
affirms that liberation can be achieved only by the mercy of Viñëu. Lord Çiva
says:

mukti-pradätä sarveñäà viñëur eva na saàçayaù.

"There is no doubt that Viñëu is the deliverer of liberation for everyone.

TRANSLATION
Those miscreants who are grossly foolish, lowest among mankind, whose knowledge

surrender unto Me.

PURPORT
It is said in Bhagavad-gétä that simply by surrendering oneself unto the lotus
feet of the Supreme Personality Kåñëa, one can surmount the stringent laws of
material nature. At this point a question arises: How is it that educated
philosophers, scientists, businessmen, administrators and all the leaders of
ordinary men do not surrender to the lotus feet of Çré Kåñëa, the all-powerful
Personality of Godhead? Mukti, or liberation from the laws of material nature,
is sought by the leaders of mankind in different ways and with great plans and
perseverance for a great many years and births. But if that liberation is
possible by simply surrendering unto the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, then why don't these intelligent and hard-working leaders adopt this
simple method?

The Gétä answers this question very frankly. Those really learned leaders of
society like Brahmä, Çiva, Kapila, the Kumäras, Manu, Vyäsa, Devala, Asita,
Janaka, Prahläda, Bali, and later on Madhväcärya, Rämänujäcärya, Çré Caitanya
and many others—who are faithful philosophers, politicians, educators,
scientists, etc.—surrender to the lotus feet of the Supreme Person, the
all-powerful authority. Those who are not actually philosophers, scientists,
educators, administrators, etc., but who pose themselves as such for material
gain, do not accept the plan or path of the Supreme Lord. They have no idea of
God; they simply manufacture their own worldly plans and consequently complicate
the problems of material existence in their vain attempts to solve them. Because
material energy (nature) is so powerful, it can resist the unauthorized plans of
the atheists and baffle the knowledge of "planning commissions."

The atheistic plan-makers are described herein by the word duñkåtina, or
"miscreants." Kåtina means one who has performed meritorious work. The atheist
planmaker is sometimes very intelligent and meritorious also, because any
gigantic plan, good or bad, must take intelligence to execute. But because the
atheist’s brain is improperly utilized in opposing the plan of the Supreme Lord,
the atheistic planmaker is called duñkåtina, which indicates that his
intelligence and efforts are misdirected.

In the Gétä it is clearly mentioned that material energy works fully under the
direction of the Supreme Lord. It has no independant authority. It works as the
shadow moves, in accordance with the movements of the object. But still material
energy is very powerful, and the atheist, due to his godless temperament, cannot
know how it works; nor can he know the plan of the Supreme Lord. Under illusion
and the modes of passion and ignorance, all his plans are baffled, as in the
case of Hiraëyakaçipu and Rävaëa, whose plans were smashed to dust although they
were both materially learned as scientists, philosophers, administrators and
educators. These duñkåtinas, or miscreants, are of four different patterns, as
outlined below:

(1) The müòhas are those who are grossly foolish, like hard-working beasts of
burden. They want to enjoy the fruits of their labor by themselves, and so do
not want to part with them for the Supreme. The typical example of the beast of
burden is the ass. This humble beast is made to work very hard by his master.
The ass does not really know for whom he works so hard day and night. He remains
satisfied by filling his stomach with a bundle of grass, sleeping for a while
under fear of being beaten by his master, and satisfying his sex appetite at the
risk of being repeatedly kicked by the opposite party. The ass sings poetry and
philosophy sometimes, but this braying only disturbs others. This is the
position of the foolish fruitive worker who does not know for whom he should
work. He does not know that karma (action) is meant for yajïa (sacrifice).

Most often, those who work very hard day and night to clear the burden of
self-created duties say that they have no time to hear of the immortality of the
living being. To such müòhas, material gains, which are destructible, are life’s
all in all—despite the fact that the müòhas enjoy only a very small fraction of
the fruit of labor. Sometimes they spend sleepless days and nights for fruitive
gain, and although they may have ulcers or indigestion, they are satisfied with
practically no food; they are simply absorbed in working hard day and night for
the benefit of illusory masters. Ignorant of their real master, the foolish
workers waste their valuable time serving mammon. Unfortunately, they never
surrender to the supreme master of all masters, nor do they take time to hear of
Him from the proper sources. The swine who eat the soil do not care to accept
sweetmeats made of sugar and ghee. Similarly, the foolish worker will untiringly
continue to hear of the sense-enjoyable tidings of the flickering mundane force
that moves the material world.

(2) Another class of duñkåtina, or miscreant, is called the narädhama, or the
lowest of mankind. Nara means human being, and adhama means the lowest. Out of
the 8,400,000 different species of living beings, there are 400,000 human
species. Out of these there are numerous lower forms of human life that are
mostly uncivilized. The civilized human beings are those who have regulated
principles of social, political and religious life. Those who are socially and
politically developed, but who have no religious principles, must be considered
narädhamas. Nor is religion without God religion, because the purpose of
following religious principles is to know the Supreme Truth and man’s relation
with Him. In the Gétä the Personality of Godhead clearly states that there is no
authority above Him and that He is the Supreme Truth. The civilized form of
human life is meant for man’s reviving the lost consciousness of his eternal
relation with the Supreme Truth, the Personality of Godhead Çré Kåñëa, who is
all-powerful. Whoever loses this chance is classified as a narädhama. We get
information from revealed scriptures that when the baby is in the mother’s womb
(an extremely uncomfortable situation) he prays to God for deliverance and
promises to worship Him alone as soon as he gets out. To pray to God when he is
in difficulty is a natural instinct in every living being because he is
eternally related with God. But after his deliverance, the child forgets the
difficulties of birth and forgets his deliverer also, being influenced by mäyä,
the illusory energy.

It is the duty of the guardians of children to revive the divine consciousness
dormant in them. The ten processes of reformatory ceremonies, as enjoined in the
Manu-småti, which is the guide to religious principles, are meant for reviving
God consciousness in the system of varëäçrama. However, no process is strictly
followed now in any part of the world, and therefore 99.9 percent of the
population is narädhama.

When the whole population becomes narädhama, naturally all their so-called
education is made null and void by the all-powerful energy of physical nature.
According to the standard of the Gétä, a learned man is he who sees on equal
terms the learned brähmaëa, the dog, the cow, the elephant and the dog-eater.
That is the vision of a true devotee. Çré Nityänanda Prabhu, who is the
incarnation of Godhead as divine master, delivered the typical narädhamas, the
brothers Jagai and Madhai, and showed how the mercy of a real devotee is
bestowed upon the lowest of mankind. So the narädhama who is condemned by the
Personality of Godhead can again revive his spiritual consciousness only by the
mercy of a devotee.

Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu, in propagating the bhägavata-dharma or activities of
the devotees, has recommended that people submissively hear the message of the
Personality of Godhead. The essence of this message is Bhagavad-gétä. The lowest
amongst human beings can be delivered by this submissive hearing process only,
but unfortunately they even deny giving an aural reception to these messages,
and what to speak of surrendering to the will of the Supreme Lord? Narädhamas,
or the lowest of mankind, will fully neglect the prime duty of the human being.

(3) The next class of duñkåtina is called mäyayäpahåta-jïäna, or those persons
whose erudite knowledge has been nullified by the influence of illusory material
energy. They are mostly very learned fellows—great philosophers, poets,
literati, scientists, etc.—but the illusory energy misguides them, and therefore
they disobey the Supreme Lord.

There are a great number of mäyayäpahåta-jïänas at the present moment, even
amongst the scholars of the Gétä. In the Gétä, in plain and simple language, it
is stated that Çré Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There is none
equal to or greater than Him. He is mentioned as the father of Brahmä, the
original father of all human beings. In fact, Çré Kåñëa is said to be not only
the father of Brahmä but also the father of all species of life. He is the root
of the impersonal Brahman and Paramätmä; the Supersoul in every entity is His
plenary portion. He is the fountainhead of everything, and everyone is advised
to surrender unto His lotus feet. Despite all these clear statements, the
mäyayäpahåta-jïäna deride the Personality of the Supreme Lord and consider Him
merely another human being. They do not know that the blessed form of human life
is designed after the eternal and transcendental feature of the Supreme Lord.

All the unauthorized interpretations of the Gétä by the class of
mäyayäpahåta-jïäna, outside the purview of the paramparä system, are so many
stumbling blocks in the path of spiritual understanding. The deluded
interpreters do not surrender unto the lotus feet of Çré Kåñëa, nor do they
teach others to follow this principle.

(4) The last class of duñkåtina is called äsuraà bhävam äçrita, or those of
demonic principles. This class is openly atheistic. Some of them argue that the
Supreme Lord can never descend upon this material world, but they are unable to
give any tangible reasons as to why not. There are others who make Him
subordinate to the impersonal feature, although the opposite is declared in the
Gétä. Envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the atheist will present a
number of illicit incarnations manufactured in the factory of his brain. Such
persons whose very principle of life is to decry the Personality of Godhead
cannot surrender unto the lotus feet of Çré Kåñëa.

Çré Yämunäcärya Albandru of South India said, "O my Lord! You are unknowable to
persons involved with atheistic principles despite Your uncommon qualities,
features, and activities and despite Your personality being confirmed by all the
revealed scriptures in the quality of goodness, and despite Your being
acknowledged by the famous authorities renowned for their depth of knowledge in
the transcendental science and situated in the godly qualities."

Therefore, (1) grossly foolish persons, (2) the lowest of mankind, (3) the
deluded speculators, and (4) the professed atheists, as above mentioned, never
surrender unto the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead in spite of all
scriptural and authoritative advice.

TRANSLATION
O best among the Bhäratas [Arjuna], four kinds of pious men render devotional
service unto Me—the distressed, the desirer of wealth, the inquisitive, and he
who is searching for knowledge of the Absolute.

PURPORT
Unlike the miscreants, these are adherents of the regulative principles of the
scriptures, and they are called sukåtina, or those who obey the rules and
regulations of scriptures, the moral and social laws, and are, more or less,
devoted to the Supreme Lord. Out of these there are four classes of men—those
who are sometimes distressed, those who are in need of money, those who are
sometimes inquisitive, and those who are sometimes searching after knowledge of
the Absolute Truth. These persons come to the Supreme Lord for devotional
service under different conditions. These are not pure devotees because they
have some aspiration to fulfill in exchange for devotional service. Pure
devotional service is without aspiration and without desire for material profit.
The Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu defines pure devotion thus:

anyäbhiläñitäçünyaà jïäna-karmädy-anävåtam
änukülyena kåñëänuçélanaà bhaktir uttamä.

"One should render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord Kåñëa
favorably and without desire for material profit or gain through fruitive
activities or philosophical speculation. That is called pure devotional
service."

When these four kinds of persons come to the Supreme Lord for devotional service
and are completely purified by the association of a pure devotee, they also
become pure devotees. As far as the miscreants are concerned, for them
devotional service is very difficult because their lives are selfish, irregular
and without spiritual goals. But even some of them, by chance, when they come in
contact with a pure devotee, also become pure devotees.

Those who are always busy with fruitive activities come to the Lord in material
distress and at that time associate with pure devotees and become, in their
distress, devotees of the Lord. Those who are simply frustrated also come
sometimes to associate with the pure devotees and become inquisitive to know
about God. Similarly, when the dry philosophers are frustrated in every field of
knowledge, they sometimes want to learn of God, and they come to the Supreme
Lord to render devotional service and thus transcend knowledge of the impersonal
Brahman and the localized Paramätmä and come to the personal conception of
Godhead by the grace of the Supreme Lord or His pure devotee. On the whole, when
the distressed, the inquisitive, the seekers of knowledge, and those who are in
need of money are free from all material desires, and when they fully understand
that material remuneration has nothing to do with spiritual improvement, they
become pure devotees. As long as such a purified stage is not attained, devotees
in transcendental service to the Lord are tainted with fruitive activities, and
they search after mundane knowledge, etc. So one has to transcend all this
before one can come to the stage of pure devotional service.

TRANSLATION
Of these, the wise one who is in full knowledge in union with Me through pure
devotional service is the best. For I am very dear to him, and he is dear to Me.

PURPORT
Free from all contaminations of material desires, the distressed, the
inquisitive, the penniless, and the seeker after supreme knowledge can all
become pure devotees. But out of them, he who is in knowledge of the Absolute
Truth and free from all material desires becomes a really pure devotee of the
Lord. And of the four orders, the devotee who is in full knowledge and is at the
same time engaged in devotional service is, the Lord says, the best. By
searching after knowledge one realizes that his self is different from his
material body, and when further advanced he comes to the knowledge of impersonal
Brahman and Paramätmä. When one is fully purified, he realizes that his
constitutional position is to be the eternal servant of God. So by association
with pure devotees, the inquisitive, the distressed, the seeker after material
amelioration and the man in knowledge all become themselves pure. But in the
preparatory stage, the man who is in full knowledge of the Supreme Lord and is
at the same time executing devotional service is very dear to the Lord. He who
is situated in pure knowledge of the transcendence of the Supreme Personality of
God is so protected in devotional service that material contaminations cannot
touch him.

TRANSLATION
All these devotees are undoubtedly magnanimous souls, but he who is situated in
knowledge of Me I consider verily to dwell in Me. Being engaged in My
transcendental service, he attains Me.

PURPORT
It is not that other devotees who are less complete in knowledge are not dear to
the Lord. The Lord says that all are magnanimous because anyone who comes to the
Lord for any purpose is called a mahätmä or great soul. The devotees who want
some benefit out of devotional service are accepted by the Lord because there is
an exchange of affection. Out of affection they ask the Lord for some material
benefit, and when they get it they become so satisfied that they also advance in
devotional service. But the devotee in full knowledge is considered to be very
dear to the Lord because his only purpose is to serve the Supreme Lord with love
and devotion. Such a devotee cannot live a second without contacting or serving
the Supreme Lord. Similarly, the Supreme Lord is very fond of His devotee and
cannot be separated from him.

In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam (9.4.57), the Lord says:

ahaà bhakta-parädhéno hy asvatantra iva dvija
sädhubhir grasta-hådayo bhaktair bhakta-jana-priyaù

"The devotees are always in My heart, and I am always in the heart of the
devotees. The devotee does not know anything beyond Me, and I also cannot forget
the devotee. There is a very intimate relationship between Me and the pure
devotees. Pure devotees in full knowledge are never out of spiritual touch, and
therefore they are very much dear to Me."

TRANSLATION
After many births and deaths, he who is actually in knowledge surrenders unto
Me, knowing Me to be the cause of all causes and all that is. Such a great soul
is very rare.

PURPORT
The living entity, while executing devotional service or transcendental rituals
after many, many births, may actually become situated in transcendental pure
knowledge that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ultimate goal of
spiritual realization. In the beginning of spiritual realization, while one is
trying to give up one’s attachment to materialism, there is some leaning towards
impersonalism, but when one is further advanced he can understand that there are
activities in the spiritual life and that these activities constitute devotional
service. Realizing this, he becomes attached to the Supreme Personality of
Godhead and surrenders to Him. At such a time one can understand that Lord Çré
Kåñëa’s mercy is everything, that He is the cause of all causes and that this
material manifestation is not independant from Him. He realizes the material
world to be a perverted reflection of spiritual variegatedness and realizes that
in everything there is a relationship with the Supreme Lord Kåñëa. Thus he
thinks of everything in relation to Väsudeva, or Çré Kåñëa. Such a universal
vision of Väsudeva precipitates one’s full surrender to the Supreme Lord Çré
Kåñëa as the highest goal. Such surrendered great souls are very rare.

This verse is very nicely explained in the Third Chapter of Çvetäçvatara
Upaniñad: "In this body there are powers of speaking, of seeing, of hearing, of
mental activities, etc. But these are not important if not related to the
Supreme Lord. And because Väsudeva is all-pervading and everything is Väsudeva,
the devotee surrenders in full knowledge." (Cf. Bhagavad-gétä 7.17 and 11.40)

TRANSLATION
Those whose minds are distorted by material desires surrender unto demigods and
follow the particular rules and regulations of worship according to their own
natures.

PURPORT
Those who are freed from all material contaminations surrender unto the Supreme
Lord and engage in His devotional service. As long as the material contamination
is not completely washed off, they are by nature nondevotees. But even those who
have material desires and who resort to the Supreme Lord are not so much
attracted by external nature; because of approaching the right goal, they soon
become free from all material lust. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam it is recommended
that whether one is free from all material desires, or is full of material
desires, or desires liberation from material contamination, or is a pure devotee
and has no desire for material sense gratification, he should in all cases
surrender to Väsudeva and worship Him.

It is said in the Bhägavatam that less intelligent people who have lost their
spiritual sense take shelter of demigods for immediate fulfillment of material
desires. Generally, such people do not go to the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
because they are in particular modes of nature (ignorance and passion) and
therefore worship various demigods. Following the rules and regulations of
worship, they are satisfied. The worshipers of demigods are motivated by small
desires and do not know how to reach the supreme goal, but a devotee of the
Supreme Lord is not misguided. Because in Vedic literature there are
recommendations for worshiping different gods for different purposes (e.g., a
diseased man is recommended to worship the sun), those who are not devotees of
the Lord think that for certain purposes demigods are better than the Supreme
Lord. But a pure devotee knows that the Supreme Lord Kåñëa is the master of all.
In the Caitanya-caritämåta it is said that only the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, Kåñëa, is master and all others are servants. Therefore a pure devotee
never goes to demigods for satisfaction of his material needs. He depends on the
Supreme Lord. And the pure devotee is satisfied with whatever He gives.

TRANSLATION
I am in everyone’s heart as the Supersoul. As soon as one desires to worship the
demigods, I make his faith steady so that he can devote himself to some
particular deity.

PURPORT
God has given independence to everyone; therefore, if a person desires to have
material enjoyment and wants very sincerely to have such facilities from the
material demigods, the Supreme Lord, as Supersoul in everyone’s heart,
understands and gives facilities to such persons. As the supreme father of all
living entities, He does not interfere with their independence, but gives all
facilities so that they can fulfill their material desires. Some may ask why the
all-powerful God gives facilities to the living entities for enjoying this
material world and so lets them fall into the trap of the illusory energy. The
answer is that if the Supreme Lord as Supersoul does not give such facilities,
then there is no meaning to independence. Therefore He gives everyone full
independence—whatever one likes—but His ultimate instruction we find in the
Bhagavad-gétä: man should give up all other engagements and fully surrender unto
Him. That will make man happy.

Both the living entity and the demigods are subordinate to the will of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead; therefore the living entity cannot worship the
demigod by his own desire, nor can the demigod bestow any benediction without
the supreme will. As it is said, not a blade of grass moves without the will of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Generally, persons who are distressed in the
material world go to the demigods, as they are advised in the Vedic literature.
A person wanting some particular thing may worship such and such a demigod. For
example, a diseased person is recommended to worship the sun-god; a person
wanting education may worship the goddess of learning, Sarasvaté; and a person
wanting a beautiful wife may worship the goddess Umä, the wife of Lord Çiva. In
this way there are recommendations in the çästras (Vedic scriptures) for
different modes of worship of different demigods. And because a particular
living entity wants to enjoy a particular material facility, the Lord inspires
him with a strong desire to achieve that benediction from that particular
demigod, and so he successfully receives the benediction. The particular mode of
the devotional attitude of the living entity toward a particular type of demigod
is also arranged by the Supreme Lord. The demigods cannot infuse the living
entities with such an affinity, but because He is the Supreme Lord or the
Supersoul who is present in the heart of all living entities, Kåñëa gives
impetus to man to worship certain demigods. The demigods are actually different
parts of the universal body of the Supreme Lord; therefore they have no
independence. In the Vedic literature (Taittiréya Upaniñad, First Anuväka) it is
stated: "The Supreme Personality of Godhead as Supersoul is also present within
the heart of the demigod; therefore He arranges through the demigod to fulfill
the desire of the living entity. But both the demigod and the living entity are
dependant on the supreme wil1. They are not independant."

TRANSLATION
Endowed with such a faith, he seeks favors of a particular demigod and obtains
his desires. But in actuality these benefits are bestowed by Me alone.

PURPORT
The demigods cannot award benediction to the devotees without the permission of
the Supreme Lord. The living entity may forget that everything is the property
of the Supreme Lord, but the demigods do not forget. So the worship of demigods
and achievement of desired results are not due to the demigods but to the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, by arrangement. The less intelligent living
entity does not know this, and therefore he foolishly goes to the demigods for
some benefit. But the pure devotee, when in need of something, prays only to the
Supreme Lord. Asking for material benefit, however, is not a sign of a pure
devotee. A living entity goes to the demigods usually because he is mad to
fulfill his lust. This happens when something undue is desired by the living
entity, and the Lord Himself does not fulfill the desire. In the
Caitanya-caritämåta it is said that one who worships the Supreme Lord and at the
same time desires material enjoyment is contradictory in his desires. Devotional
service of the Supreme Lord and the worship of a demigod cannot be on the same
platform because worship of a demigod is material and devotional service to the
Supreme Lord is completely spiritual.

For the living entity who desires to return to Godhead, material desires are
impediments. A pure devotee of the Lord is therefore not awarded the material
benefits desired by less intelligent living entities who prefer to worship
demigods of the material world rather than engage in devotional service of the
Supreme Lord.

TRANSLATION
Men of small intelligence worship the demigods, and their fruits are limited and
temporary. Those who worship the demigods go to the planets of the demigods, but
My devotees ultimately reach My supreme planet.

PURPORT
Some commentators on the Gétä say that one who worships a demigod can reach the
Supreme Lord, but here it is clearly stated that the worshipers of demigods go
to the different planetary systems where various demigods are situated, just as
a worshiper of the sun achieves the sun or a worshiper of the demigod of the
moon achieves the moon. Similarly, if anyone wants to worship a demigod like
Indra, he can attain that particular god’s planet. It is not that everyone,
regardless of whatever demigod is worshiped, will reach the Supreme Personality
of Godhead. That is denied here, for it is clearly stated that the worshipers of
demigods go to different planets in the material world, but the devotee of the
Supreme Lord goes directly to the supreme planet of the Personality of Godhead.

Here the point may be raised that if the demigods are different parts of the
body of the Supreme Lord, then the same end should be achieved by worshiping
them. However, worshipers of the demigods are less intelligent because they
don't know to what part of the body food must be supplied. Some of them are so
foolish that they claim that there are many parts and many ways to supply food.
This isn't very sanguine. Can anyone supply food to the body through the ears or
eyes? They do not know that these demigods are different parts of the universal
body of the Supreme Lord, and in their ignorance they believe that each and
every demigod is a separate God and a competitor of the Supreme Lord.

Not only are demigods parts of the Supreme Lord, but ordinary living entities
are also. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam it is stated that the brähmaëas are the head
of the Supreme Lord, the kñatriyas are the arms, etc., and that all serve
different functions. Regardless of the situation, if one knows that both the
demigods and himself are part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, his knowledge is
perfect. But if he does not understand this, he achieves different planets where
the demigods reside. This is not the same destination the devotee reaches.

The results achieved by the demigods’ benedictions are perishable because within
this material world the planets, the demigods and their worshipers are all
perishable. Therefore it is clearly stated in this verse that all results
achieved by worshiping demigods are perishable, and therefore such worship is
performed by the less intelligent living entity. Because the pure devotee
engaged in Kåñëa consciousness in devotional service of the Supreme Lord
achieves eternal blissful existence that is full of knowledge, his achievements
and those of the common worshiper of the demigods are different. The Supreme
Lord is unlimited; His favor is unlimited; His mercy is unlimited. Therefore the
mercy of the Supreme Lord upon His pure devotees is unlimited.

TRANSLATION
Unintelligent men, who know Me not, think that I have assumed this form and

which is changeless and supreme.

PURPORT
Those who are worshipers of demigods have been described as less intelligent
persons, and here the impersonalists are similarly described. Lord Kåñëa in His
personal form is here speaking before Arjuna, and still, due to ignorance,
impersonalists argue that the Supreme Lord ultimately has no form. Yämunäcärya,
a great devotee of the Lord in the disciplic succession from Rämänujäcärya, has
written two very appropriate verses in this connection. He says, "My dear Lord,
devotees like Vyäsadeva and Närada know You to be the Personality of Godhead. By
understanding different Vedic literatures, one can come to know Your
characteristics, Your form and Your activities, and one can thus understand that
You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead. But those who are in the modes of
passion and ignorance, the demons, the nondevotees, cannot understand You. They
are unable to understand You. However expert such nondevotees may be in
discussing Vedänta and the Upaniñads and other Vedic literatures, it is not
possible for them to understand the Personality of Godhead."

In the Brahma-saàhitä it is stated that the Personality of Godhead cannot be
understood simply by study of the Vedänta literature. Only by the mercy of the
Supreme Lord can the Personality of the Supreme be known. Therefore in this
verse it is clearly stated that not only the worshipers of the demigods are less
intelligent, but those nondevotees who are engaged in Vedänta and speculation on
Vedic literature without any tinge of true Kåñëa consciousness are also less
intelligent, and for them it is not possible to understand God’s personal
nature. Persons who are under the impression that the Absolute Truth is
impersonal are described as asuras, which means one who does not know the
ultimate feature of the Absolute Truth. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam it is stated
that supreme realization begins from the impersonal Brahman and then rises to
the localized Supersoul—but the ultimate word in the Absolute Truth is the
Personality of Godhead. Modern impersonalists are still less intelligent, for
they do not even follow their great predecessor, Çaìkaräcärya, who has
specifically stated that Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Impersonalists, therefore, not knowing the Supreme Truth, think Kåñëa to be only
the son of Devaké and Vasudeva, or a prince, or a powerful living entity. This
is also condemned in Bhagavad-gétä: "Only the fools regard Me as an ordinary
person." The fact is that no one can understand Kåñëa without rendering
devotional service and without developing Kåñëa consciousness. The Gétä confirms
this.

One cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, or His form,
quality or name simply by mental speculation or by discussing Vedic literature.
One must understand Him by devotional service. When one is fully engaged in
Kåñëa consciousness, beginning by chanting the mahämantra—Hare Kåñëa, Hare
Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare—then
only can one understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Nondevotee
impersonalists think that Kåñëa has a body made of this material nature and that
all His activities, His form and everything, are mäyä. These impersonalists are
known as Mäyävädé. They do not know the ultimate truth.

The twentieth verse clearly states: "Those who are blinded by lusty desires
surrender unto the different demigods." It is accepted that besides the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, there are demigods who have their different planets (Bg.
7.23), and the Lord also has a planet. It is also stated that the worshipers of
the demigods go to the different planets of the demigods, and those who are
devotees of Lord Kåñëa go to the Kåñëaloka planet. Although this is clearly
stated, the foolish impersonalists still maintain that the Lord is formless and
that these forms are impositions. From the study of the Gétä does it appear that
the demigods and their abodes are impersonal? Clearly, neither the demigods nor
Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, are impersonal. They are all persons;
Lord Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He has His own planet, and
the demigods have theirs.

Therefore the monistic contention that ultimate truth is formless and that form
is imposed does not hold true. It is clearly stated here that it is not imposed.
From the Gétä we can clearly understand that the forms of the demigods and the
form of the Supreme Lord are simultaneously existing and that Lord Kåñëa is
sac-cid-änanda, eternal blissful knowledge. The Vedas also confirm that the
Supreme Absolute Truth is änandamaya, or full of blissful pleasure, and that He
is abhyäsät, by nature the reservoir of unlimited auspicious qualities. And in
the Gétä the Lord says that although He is aja (unborn), He still appears. These
are the facts that we should understand from the Gétä. We cannot understand how
the Supreme Personality of Godhead can be impersonal; the imposition theory of
the impersonalist monist is false as far as the statements of the Gétä are
concerned. It is clear herein that the Supreme Absolute Truth, Lord Kåñëa, has
both form and personality.

TRANSLATION
I am never manifest to the foolish and unintelligent. For them I am covered by
My eternal creative potency [yoga-mäyä]; and so the deluded world knows Me not,
who am unborn and infallible.

PURPORT
lt may be argued that since Kåñëa was present on this earth and was visible to
everyone, then why isn't He manifest to everyone now? But actually He was not
manifest to everyone. When Kåñëa was present there were only a few people who
could understand Him to be the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the assembly
of Kurus, when Çiçupäla spoke against Kåñëa being elected president of the
assembly, Bhéñma supported Him and proclaimed Him to be the Supreme God.
Similarly, the Päëòavas and a few others knew that He was the Supreme, but not
everyone. He was not revealed to the nondevotees and the common man. Therefore
in the Gétä Kåñëa says that but for His pure devotees, all men consider Him to
be like themselves. He was manifest only to His devotees as the reservoir of all
pleasure. But to others, to unintelligent nondevotees, He was covered by His
eternal potency.

In the prayers of Kunté in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam (1.8.18), it is said that the
Lord is covered by the curtain of yoga-mäyä and thus ordinary people cannot
understand Him. Kunté prays: "O my Lord, You are the maintainer of the entire
universe, and devotional service to You is the highest religious principle.
Therefore, I pray that You will also maintain me. Your transcendental form is
covered by the yoga-mäyä. The brahmajyoti is the covering of the internal
potency. May You kindly remove this glowing effulgence that impedes my seeing
Your sac-cid-änanda-vigraha, Your eternal form of bliss and knowledge."

This yoga-mäyä curtain is also mentioned in the Fifteenth Chapter of the Gétä.
The Supreme Personality of Godhead in His transcendental form of bliss and
knowledge is covered by the eternal potency of brahmajyoti and the less
intelligent impersonalists cannot see the Supreme on this account. Also in the
Çrémad-Bhägavatam (10.14.7) there is this prayer by Brahmä: "O Supreme
Personality of Godhead, O Supersoul, O master of all mystery, who can calculate
Your potency and pastimes in this world? You are always expanding Your eternal
potency, and therefore no one can understand You. Learned scientists and learned
scholars can examine the atomic constitution of the material world or even the
planets, but still they are unable to calculate Your energy and potency,
although You are present before them." The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord
Kåñëa, is not only unborn, but He is avyaya, inexhaustible. His eternal form is
bliss and knowledge, and His energies are all inexhaustible.

O Arjuna, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, I know everything that has

PURPORT
Here the question of personality and impersonality is clearly stated. If Kåñëa,
the form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is considered by the
impersonalists to be mäyä, to be material, then He would, like the living
entity, change His body and forget everything in His past life. Anyone with a
material body cannot remember his past life, nor can he foretell his future
life, nor can he predict the outcome of his present life; therefore he cannot
know what is happening in past, present and future. Unless one is liberated from
material contamination, he cannot know past, present and future.

Unlike the ordinary human being, Lord Kåñëa clearly says that He completely
knows what happened in the past, what is happening in the present, and what will
happen in the future. In the Fourth Chapter we have seen that Lord Kåñëa
remembers instructing Vivasvän, the sun-god, millions of years ago. Kåñëa knows
every living entity because He is situated in every living being’s heart as the
Supreme Soul. But despite His presence in every living entity as Supersoul and
His presence beyond the material sky, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the
less intelligent cannot realize Him as the Supreme Person. Certainly the
transcendental body of Çré Kåñëa is not perishable. He is just like the sun, and
mayä is like the cloud. In the material world we can see that there is the sun
and that there are clouds and different stars and planets. The clouds may cover
all these in the sky temporarily, but this covering is only apparent to our
limited vision. The sun, moon and stars are not actually covered. Similarly,
mäyä cannot cover the Supreme Lord. By His internal potency He is not manifest
to the less intelligent class of men. As it is stated in the third verse of this
chapter, out of millions and millions of men, some try to become perfect in this
human form of life, and out of thousands and thousands of such perfected men,
hardly one can understand what Lord Kåñëa is. Even if one is perfected by
realization of impersonal Brahman or localized Paramätmä, he cannot possibly
understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Çré Kåñëa, without being in Kåñëa
consciousness.

TRANSLATION
O scion of Bharata [Arjuna], O conquerer of the foe, all living entities are
born into delusion, overcome by the dualities of desire and hate.

PURPORT
The real constitutional position of the living entity is that of subordination
to the Supreme Lord, who is pure knowledge. When one is deluded into separation
from this pure knowledge, he becomes controlled by illusory energy and cannot
understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The illusory energy is manifested
in the duality of desire and hate. Due to desire and hate, the ignorant person
wants to become one with the Supreme Lord and envies Kåñëa as the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. Pure devotees, who are not so deluded or contaminated by
desire and hate, can understand that Lord Çré Kåñëa appears by His internal
potencies, but those who are deluded by duality and nescience think that the
Supreme Personality of Godhead is created by material energies. This is their
misfortune. Such deluded persons, symptomatically, dwell in dualities of
dishonor and honor, misery and happiness, woman and man, good and bad, pleasure
and pain, etc., thinking, "This is my wife; this is my house; I am the master of
this house; I am the husband of this wife." These are the dualities of delusion.
Those who are so deluded by dualities are completely foolish and therefore
cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

TRANSLATION
Persons who have acted piously in previous lives and in this life, whose sinful
actions are completely eradicated and who are freed from the duality of
delusion, engage themselves in My service with determination.

PURPORT
Those eligible for elevation to the transcendental position are mentioned in
this verse. For those who are sinful, atheistic, foolish and deceitful, it is
very difficult to transcend the duality of desire and hate. Only those who have
passed their lives in practicing the regulative principles of religion, who have
acted piously and have conquered sinful reactions can accept devotional service
and gradually rise to the pure knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Then, gradually, they can meditate in trance on the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. That is the process of being situated on the spiritual platform. This
elevation is possible in Kåñëa consciousness in the association of pure devotees
who can deliver one from delusion.

It is stated in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam that if one actually wants to be liberated
he must render service to the devotees; but one who associates with
materialistic people is on the path leading to the darkest region of existence.
All the devotees of the Lord traverse this earth just to recover the conditioned
souls from their delusion. The impersonalists do not know that forgetting their
constitutional position as subordinate to the Supreme Lord is the greatest
violation of God’s law. Unless one is reinstated in his own constitutional
position, it is not possible to understand the Supreme Personality or to be
fully engaged in His transcendental loving service with determination.

TRANSLATION
Intelligent persons who are endeavoring for liberation from old age and death
take refuge in Me in devotional service. They are actually Brahman because they
entirely know everything about transcendental and fruitive activities.

PURPORT
Birth, death, old age and diseases affect this material body, but not the
spiritual body. There is no birth, death, old age and disease for the spiritual
body, so one who attains a spiritual body, becomes one of the associates of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead and engages in eternal devotional service, is
really liberated. Ahaà brahmäsmi: I am spirit. It is said that one should
understand that he is Brahman—spirit soul. This Brahman conception of life is
also in devotional service, as described in this verse. The pure devotees are
transcendentally situated on the Brahman platform, and they know everything
about transcendental and material activities.

Four kinds of impure devotees who engage themselves in the transcendental
service of the Lord achieve their respective goals, and by the grace of the
Supreme Lord, when they are fully Kåñëa conscious, they actually enjoy spiritual
association with the Supreme Lord. But those who are worshipers of demigods
never reach the Supreme Lord in His supreme planet. Even the less intelligent
Brahman-realized persons cannot reach the supreme planet of Kåñëa known as
Goloka Våndävana. Only persons who perform activities in Kåñëa consciousness
(mäm äçritya) are actually entitled to be called Brahman, because they are
actually endeavoring to reach the Kåñëa planet. Such persons have no misgivings
about Kåñëa, and thus they are factually Brahman.

Those who are engaged in worshiping the form or arcä of the Lord or who are
engaged in meditation on the Lord simply for liberation from material bondage,
also know, by the grace of the Lord, the purports of Brahman, adhibhüta, etc.,
as explained by the Lord in the next chapter.

TRANSLATION
Those who know Me as the Supreme Lord, as the governing principle of the
material manifestation, who know Me as the one underlying all the demigods and
as the one sustaining all sacrifices, can, with steadfast mind, understand and
know Me even at the time of death.

PURPORT
Persons acting in Kåñëa consciousness are never entirely deviated from the path
of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the transcendental
association of Kåñëa consciousness, one can understand how the Supreme Lord is
the governing principle of the material manifestation and even of the demigods.
Gradually, by such transcendental association, one becomes convinced of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself, and at the time of death such a Kåñëa
conscious person can never forget Kåñëa. Naturally he is thus promoted to the
planet of the Supreme Lord, Goloka Våndävana.

This Seventh Chapter particularly explains how one can become a fully Kåñëa
conscious person. The beginning of Kåñëa consciousness is association of persons
who are Kåñëa conscious. Such association is spiritual and puts one directly in
touch with the Supreme Lord, and, by His grace, one can understand Kåñëa to be
the Supreme God. At the same time one can really understand the constitutional
position of the living entity and how the living entity forgets Kåñëa and
becomes entangled in material activities. By gradual development of Kåñëa
consciousness in good association, the living entity can understand that due to
forgetfulness of Kåñëa he has become conditioned by the laws of material nature.
He can also understand that this human form of life is an opportunity to regain
Kåñëa consciousness and that it should be fully utilized to attain the causeless
mercy of the Supreme Lord.

Many subjects have been discussed in this chapter: the man in distress, the
inquisitive man, the man in want of material necessities, knowledge of Brahman,
knowledge of Paramätmä, liberation from birth, death and diseases, and worship
of the Supreme Lord. However, he who is actually elevated in Kåñëa consciousness
does not care for the different processes. He simply directly engages himself in
activities of Kåñëa consciousness and thereby factually attains his
constitutional position as eternal servitor of Lord Kåñëa. In such a situation
he takes pleasure in hearing and glorifying the Supreme Lord in pure devotional
service. He is convinced that by doing so, all his objectives will be fulfilled.
This determined faith is called dåòha-vrata, and it is the beginning of
bhakti-yoga or transcendental loving service. That is the verdict of all
scriptures. This Seventh Chapter of the Gétä is the substance of that
conviction.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Seventh Chapter of the
Çrémad-Bhagavad-gétä in the matter of Knowledge of the Absolute.

Person; adhibhütam—the material manifestation; ca—and; kim—what; proktam—is

TRANSLATION
Arjuna inquired: O my Lord, O Supreme Person, what is Brahman? What is the self?
What are fruitive activities? What is this material manifestation? And what are
the demigods? Please explain this to me.

PURPORT
In this chapter Lord Kåñëa answers these different questions of Arjuna beginning
with, "What is Brahman?" The Lord also explains karma, fruitive activities,
devotional service and yoga principles, and devotional service in its pure form.
The Çrémad-Bhägavatam explains that the Supreme Absolute Truth is known as
Brahman, Paramätmä, and Bhagavän. In addition, the living entity, individual
soul, is also called Brahman. Arjuna also inquires about ätmä, which refers to
body, soul and mind. According to the Vedic dictionary, ätmä refers to the mind,
soul, body and senses also.

Arjuna has addressed the Supreme Lord as Puruñottama, Supreme Person, which
means that he was putting these questions not simply to a friend but to the
Supreme Person, knowing Him to be the supreme authority able to give definitive
answers.

death; ca—and; katham—how; jïeyaù—be known; asi—You can; niyata-ätmabhiù—by the

TRANSLATION
How does this Lord of sacrifice live in the body, and in which part does He
live, O Madhusüdana? And how can those engaged in devotional service know You at
the time of death?

PURPORT
The Lord of sacrifice accepts Indra and Viñëu. Viñëu is the chief of the primal
demigods, including Brahmä and Çiva, and Indra is the chief of the
administrative demigods. Both Indra and Viñëu are worshiped by yajïa
performances. But here Arjuna asks who is actually the Lord of yajïa
(sacrifice), and how is the Lord residing within the body of the living entity.

Arjuna addresses the Lord as Madhusüdana because Kåñëa once killed a demon named
Madhu. Actually these questions, which are of the nature of doubts, should not
have arisen in the mind of Arjuna because Arjuna is a Kåñëa conscious devotee.
Therefore these doubts are like demons. Since Kåñëa is so expert in killing
demons, Arjuna here addresses Him as Madhusüdana so that Kåñëa might kill the
demonic doubts that arise in Arjuna’s mind.

Now the word prayäëa-käle in this verse is very significant because whatever we
do in life will be tested at the time of death. Arjuna fears that at the time of
death, those who are in Kåñëa consciousness will forget the Supreme Lord because
at such a time body functions are disrupted and the mind may be in a
panic-stricken state. Therefore Mahäräja Kulaçekhara, a great devotee, prays,
“My dear Lord, may I die immediately now that I’m healthy so that the swan of my
mind may enter into the stem of Thy lotus feet.” This metaphor is used because
the swan often takes pleasure in entering the stem of the lotus
flower-similarly, the mind of the pure devotee is drawn to the lotus feet of the
Lord. Mahäräja Kulaçekhara fears that at the moment of death his throat will be
so choked up that he will not be able to chant the holy names, so it is better
to “die immediately.” Arjuna questions how one’s mind can remain fixed on
Kåñëa’s lotus feet at such times.

entities; visargaù—creation; karma—fruitive activities; saàjïitaù—is called.

TRANSLATION
The Supreme Lord said, The indestructible, transcendental living entity is
called Brahman, and his eternal nature is called the self. Action pertaining to
the development of these material bodies is called karma, or fruitive
activities.

PURPORT
Brahman is indestructible and eternally existing, and its constitution is not
changed at any time. But beyond Brahman there is Parabrahman. Brahman refers to
the living entity, and Parabrahman refers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
The constitutional position of the living entity is different from the position
he takes in the material world. In material consciousness, his nature is to try
to be the lord of matter, but in spiritual (Kåñëa) consciousness, his position
is to serve the Supreme. When the living entity is in material consciousness, he
has to take on various bodies in the material world. That is called karma, or
varied creation by the force of material consciousness.

In Vedic literature the living entity is called jévätmä and Brahman, but he is
never called Parabrahman. The living entity (jévätmä) takes different
positions—sometimes he merges into the dark material nature and identifies
himself with matter, and sometimes he identifies himself with the superior
spiritual nature. Therefore he is called the Supreme Lord’s marginal energy.
According to his identification with material or spiritual nature, he receives a
material or spiritual body. In material nature he may take a body from any of
the 8,400,000 species of life, but in spiritual nature he has only one body. In
material nature he is sometimes manifested as a man, demigod, an animal, a
beast, bird, etc., according to his karma. To attain material heavenly planets
and enjoy their facilities, he sometimes performs sacrifices (yajïa), but when
his merit is exhausted, he returns to earth again in the form of a man.

ln the process of sacrifice, the living entity makes specific sacrifices to
attain specific heavenly planets and consequently reaches them. When the merit
of sacrifice is exhausted, then the living entity descends to earth in the form
of rain, then takes on the form of grains, and the grains are eaten by man and
transformed into semen, which impregnates a woman, and thus the living entity
once again attains the human form to perform sacrifice and so repeat the same
cycle. In this way, the living entity perpetually comes and goes on the material
path. The Kåñëa conscious person, however, avoids such sacrifices. He takes
directly to Kåñëa consciousness and thereby prepares himself to return to
Godhead.

Impersonalist commentators on the Gétä unreasonably assume that Brahman takes
the form of jéva in the material world, and to substantiate this they refer to
Chapter Fifteen, verse 7, of the Gétä. But this verse also speaks of the living
entity as “an eternal fragment of Myself.” The fragment of God, the living
entity, may fall down into the material world, but the Supreme Lord (Acyuta)
never falls down. Therefore this assumption that the Supreme Brahman assumes the
form of jéva is not acceptable. It is important to remember that in Vedic
literature Brahman (the living entity) is distinguished from Parabrahman (the
Supreme Lord).

TRANSLATION
Physical nature is known to be endlessly mutable. The universe is the cosmic
form of the Supreme Lord, and I am that Lord represented as the Supersoul,
dwelling in the heart of every embodied being.

PURPORT
The physical nature is constantly changing. Material bodies generally pass
through six stages: they are born, they grow, they remain for some duration,
they produce some by-products, they dwindle, and then they vanish. This physical
nature is called adhibhütam. Because it is created at a certain point and will
be annihilated at a certain point, the conception of the universal form of the
Supreme Lord that includes all the demigods and their different planets is
called adhidaivatam. The individual soul (jéva) accompanies the body. The
Supersoul, a plenary representation of Lord Kåñëa, is called the Paramätmä or
adhiyajïa and is situated in the heart. The word eva is particularly important
in the context of this verse because by this word the Lord stresses that the
Paramätmä is not different from Him. The Supersoul, the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, seated beside the individual soul, is the witness of the individual
soul’s activities and is the source of consciousness. The Supersoul gives the
jéva an opportunity to act freely, and He witnesses his activities. The
functions of all these different manifestations of the Supreme Lord
automatically become clarified for the pure Kåñëa conscious devotee engaged in
transcendental service of the Lord. The gigantic universal form of the Lord
called adhidaivatam is contemplated by the neophyte who cannot approach the
Supreme Lord in His manifestation as Supersoul. The neophyte is advised to
contemplate the universal form whose legs are considered the lowet planets and
whose eyes are considered the sun and moon, and whose head is considered the
upper planetary system.

TRANSLATION
And whoever, at the time of death, quits his body, remembering Me alone, at once
attains My nature. Of this there is no doubt.

PURPORT
In this verse the importance of Kåñëa consciousness is stressed. Anyone who
quits his body in Kåñëa consciousness is at once transferred to the
transcendental abode of the Supreme Lord. The word smaran (remembering) is
important. Remembrance of Kåñëa is not possible for the impure soul who has not
practiced Kåñëa consciousness in devotional service. To remember Kåñëa one
should chant the mahämantra, Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/
Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare, incessantly, following in the
footsteps of Lord Caitanya, being more tolerant than the tree, humbler than the
grass and offering all respect to others without requiring respect in return. In
such a way one will be able to depart from the body successfully remembering
Kåñëa and so attain the supreme goal.

TRANSLATION
Whatever state of being one remembers when he quits his body, that state he will
attain without fail.

PURPORT
The process of changing one’s nature at the critical moment of death is here
explained. How can one die in the proper state of mind? Mahäräja Bharata thought
of a deer at the time of death and so was transferred to that form of life.
However, as a deer, Mahäräja Bharata could remember his past activities. Of
course the cumulative effect of the thoughts and actions of one’s life
influences one’s thoughts at the moment of death; therefore the actions of this
life determine one’s future state of being. If one is transcendentally absorbed
in Kåñëa’s service,then his next body will be transcendental (spiritual), not
physical. Therefore the chanting of Hare Kåñëa is the best process for
successfully changing one’s state of being to transcendental life.

Therefore, Arjuna, you should always think of Me in the form of Kåñëa and at the
same time carry out your prescribed duty of fighting. With your activities
dedicated to Me and your mind and intelligence fixed on Me, you will attain Me
without doubt.

PURPORT
This instruction to Arjuna is very important for all men engaged in material
activities. The Lord does not say that one should give up his prescribed duties
or engagements. One can continue them and at the same time think of Kåñëa by
chanting Hare Kåñëa. This will free one from material contamination and engage
the mind and intelligence in Kåñëa. By chanting Kåñëa’s names, one will be
transferred to the supreme planet, Kåñëaloka, without a doubt.

TRANSLATION
He who meditates on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, his mind constantly
engaged in remembering Me, undeviated from the path, he, O Pärtha [Arjuna], is
sure to reach Me.

PURPORT
In this verse Lord Kåñëa stresses the importance of remembering Him. One’s
memory of Kåñëa is revived by chanting the mahämantra, Hare Kåñëa. By this
practice of chanting and hearing the sound vibration of the Supreme Lord, one’s
ear, tongue and mind are engaged. This mystic meditation is very easy to
practice, and it helps one attain the Supreme Lord. Puruñam means enjoyer.
Although living entities belong to the marginal energy of the Supreme Lord, they
are in material contamination. They think themselves enjoyers, but they are not
the supreme enjoyer. Here it is clearly stated that the supreme enjoyer is the
Supreme Personality of Godhead in His different manifestations and plenary
expansions as Näräyaëa, Väsudeva, etc.

The devotees can constantly think of the object of worship, the Supreme Lord, in
any of His features, Näräyaëa, Kåñëa, Räma, etc., by chanting Hare Kåñëa. This
practice will purify him, and at the end of his life, due to his constant
chanting, he will be transferred to the kingdom of God. Yoga practice is
meditation on the Supersoul within; similarly, by chanting Hare Kåñëa one fixes
his mind always on the Supreme Lord. The mind is fickle, and therefore it is
necessary to engage the mind by force to think of Kåñëa. One example often given
is that of the caterpillar that thinks of becoming a butterfly and so is
transformed into a butterfly in the same life. Similarly, if we constantly think
of Kåñëa, it is certain that at the end of our lives we shall have the same
bodily constitution as Kåñëa.

TRANSLATION
One should meditate upon the Supreme Person as the one who knows everything, as
He who is the oldest, who is the controller, who is smaller than the smallest,
who is the maintainer of everything, who is beyond all material conception, who
is inconceivable, and who is always a person. He is luminous like the sun and,
being transcendental, is beyond this material nature.

PURPORT
The process of thinking of the Supreme is mentioned in this verse. The foremost
point is that He is not impersonal or void. One cannot meditate on something
impersonal or void. That is very difficult. The process of thinking of Kåñëa,
however, is very easy and is factually stated herein. First of all, He is
puruña, spiritual, Räma and Kåñëa, and is described herein as kavim; that is, He
knows past, present and future and therefore knows everything. He is the oldest
personality because He is the origin of everything; everything is born out of
Him. He is also the supreme controller of the universe, maintainer and
instructor of humanity. He is smaller than the smallest. The living entity is
one 10,000th part of the tip of a hair, but the Lord is so inconceivably small
that He enters into the heart of this particle. Therefore He is called smaller
than the smallest. As the Supreme, He can enter into the atom and into the heart
of the smallest and control him as the Supersoul. Although so small, He is still
all-pervading and is maintaining everything. By Him all these planetary systems
are sustained. We often wonder how these big planets are floating in the air. It
is stated here that the Supreme Lord, by His inconceivable energy, is sustaining
all these big planets and systems of galaxies. The word acintya (inconceivable)
is very significant in this connection. God’s energy is beyond our conception,
beyond our thinking jurisdiction, and is therefore called inconceivable
(acintya). Who can argue this point? He pervades this material world and yet is
beyond it. We cannot even comprehend this material world, which is insignificant
compared to the spiritual world—so how can we comprehend what is beyond? Acintya
means that which is beyond this material world, that which our argument, logic
and philosophical speculation cannot touch, that which is inconceivable.
Therefore intelligent persons, avoiding useless argument and speculation, should
accept what is stated in scriptures like the Vedas, Gétä, and Çrémad-Bhägavatam
and follow the principles they set down. This will lead one to understanding.

TRANSLATION
One who, at the time of death, fixes his life air between the eyebrows and in
full devotion engages himself in remembering the Supreme Lord, will certainly
attain to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

PURPORT
In this verse it is clearly stated that at the time of death the mind must be
fixed in devotion on the Supreme Godhead. For those practiced in yoga, it is
recommended that they raise the life force between the eyebrows, but for a pure
devotee who does not practice such yoga, the mind should always be engaged in
Kåñëa consciousness so that at death he can remember the Supreme by His grace.
This is explained in verse fourteen.

The particular use of the word yoga-balena is significant in this verse because
without practice of yoga one cannot come to this transcendental state of being
at the time of death. One cannot suddenly remember the Supreme Lord at death
unless he is practiced in some yoga system, especially the system of
bhakti-yoga. Since one’s mind at death is very disturbed, one should practice
transcendence through yoga during one’s life.

TRANSLATION
Persons learned in the Vedas, who utter omkära and who are great sages in the
renounced order, enter into Brahman. Desiring such perfection, one practices
celibacy. I shall now explain to you this process by which one may attain
salvation.

PURPORT
Lord Kåñëa explains that Brahman, although one without a second, has different
manifestations and features. For the impersonalists, the syllable om is
identical with Brahman. Kåñëa here explains the impersonal Brahman in which the
renounced order of sages enter.

In the Vedic system of knowledge, students, from the very beginning, are taught
to vibrate om and learn of the ultimate impersonal Brahman by living with the
spiritual master in complete celibacy. In this way they realize two of Brahman’s
features. This practice is very essential for the student’s advancement in
spiritual life, but at the moment such brahmacäré (unmarried celibate) life is
not at all possible. The social construction of the world has changed so much
that there is no possibility of one’s practicing celibacy from the beginning of
student life. Throughout the world there are many institutions for different
departments of knowledge, but there is no recognized institution where students
can be educated in the brahmacäré principles. Unless one practices celibacy,
advancement in spiritual life is very difficult. Therefore Lord Caitanya has
announced, according to the scriptural injunctions for this age of Kali, that no
process of realizing the Supreme is possible except the chanting of the holy
name of Lord Kåñëa: Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare, Hare Räma,
Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare.

ädhäya—fixed; ätmanaù—soul; präëam—the life air; ästhitaù—situated;

TRANSLATION
The yogic situation is that of detachment from all sensual engagements. Closing
all the doors of the senses and fixing the mind on the heart and the life air at
the top of the head, one establishes himself in yoga.

PURPORT
To practice yoga, as suggested here, one first has to close the door of all
sense enjoyment. This practice is called pratyähära, or withdrawing the senses
from the sense objects. Sense organs for acquiring knowledge, such as the eyes,
ears, nose, tongue and touch, should be fully controlled and should not be
allowed to engage in self-gratification. In this way the mind focuses on the
Supersoul in the heart and the life force is raised to the top of the head. In
the Sixth Chapter this process is described in detail. But as mentioned before,
this practice is not practical in this age. The best process is Kåñëa
consciousness. If one is always able to fix his mind on Kåñëa in devotional
service, it is very easy for him to remain in an undisturbed transcendental
trance, or in samädhi.

TRANSLATION
After being situated in this yoga practice and vibrating the sacred syllable om,
the supreme combination of letters, if one thinke of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead and quits his body, he will certainly reach the spiritual planets.

PURPORT
It is clearly stated here that om, Brahman, and Lord Kåñëa are not different.
The impersonal sound of Kåñëa is om, but the sound Hare Kåñëa contains om. It is
clearly recommended in this age that if one quits his body at the end of this
life chanting the mahämantra, Hare Kåñëa, he will reach the spiritual planets.
Similarly, those who are devotees of Kåñëa enter the Kåñëa planet or Goloka
Våndävana, whereas the impersonalists remain in the brahmajyoti. The
personalists also enter many innumerable planets in the spiritual sky known as
Vaikuëöhas.

For one who remembers Me without deviation, I am easy to obtain, O son of Påthä,

PURPORT
ln this verse the bhakti-yoga of the unalloyed devotees of the Supreme Godhead
is described. The preceeding verses mention four different kinds of devotees—the
distressed, the inquisitive, those who seek material gain, and the speculative
philosophers. Different processes of liberation from material entanglement have
also been described: karma-yoga, jïäna-yoga, and haöha-yoga. But here
bhakti-yoga, without any mixture of these, is mentioned. In bhakti-yoga the
devotees desire nothing but Kåñëa. The pure bhakti devotee does not desire
promotion to heavenly planets, nor does he seek salvation or liberation from
material entanglement. A pure devotee does not desire anything. In the
Caitanya-caritämåta the pure devotee is called niñkäma, which means he has no
desire for self-interest. Perfect peace belongs to him alone, not to them who
strive for personal gain. The pure devotee only wants to please the Supreme
Lord, and so the Lord says that for anyone who is unflinchingly devoted to Him,
He is easy to attain. The devotee can render service to any of the
transcendental forms of the Supreme Lord, and he meets with none of the problems
that plague the practitioners of other yogas. Bhakti-yoga is very simple and
pure and easy to perform. One can begin by simply chanting Hare Kåñëa. Kåñëa is
very merciful to those who engage in His service, and He helps in various ways
that devotee who is fully surrendered to Him so he can understand Him as He is.
The Lord gives such a devotee sufficient intelligence so that ultimately the
devotee can attain Him in His spiritual kingdom.

The special qualification of the pure devotee is that he is always thinking of
Kåñëa without considering the time or place. There should be no impediments. He
should be able to carry out his service anywhere and at any time. Some say that
the devotee should remain in holy places like Våndävana or some holy town where
the Lord lived, but a pure devotee can live anywhere and create the atmosphere
of Våndävana by his devotional service. It was Çré Advaita who told Lord
Caitanya, “Wherever You are, O Lord—there is Våndavana.”

A pure devotee constantly remembers Kåñëa and meditates upon Him. These are
qualifications of the pure devotee for whom the Lord is most easily attainable.
Bhakti-yoga is the system that the Gétä recommends above all others. Generally,
the bhakti-yogés are engaged in five different ways: 1) çänta-bhakta, engaged in
devotional service in neutrality; 2) däsya-bhakta, engaged in devotional service
as servant; 3) säkhya-bhakta, engaged as friend; 4) vätsalya-bhakta, engaged as
parent; and 5) mädhurya-bhakta, engaged as conjugal lover of the Supreme Lord.
In any of these ways, the pure devotee is always constantly engaged in the
transcendental loving service of the Supreme Lord and cannot forget the Supreme
Lord, and so for him the Lord is easily attained. A pure devotee cannot forget
the Supreme Lord for a moment, and similarly, the Supreme Lord cannot forget His
pure devotee for a moment. This is the great blessing of the Kåñëa conscious
process of chanting the mahämantra, Hare Kåñëa.

TRANSLATION
After attaining Me, the great souls, who are yogés in devotion, never return to
this temporary world, which is full of miseries, because they have attained the
highest perfection.

PURPORT
Since this temporary material world is full of the miseries of birth, old age,
disease and death, naturally he who achieves the highest perfection and attains
the supreme planet, Kåñëaloka, Goloka Våndävana, does not wish to return. The
supreme planet is described in Vedic literature as beyond our material vision,
and it is considered the highest goal. The mahätmäs (great souls) receive
transcendental messages from the realized devotees and thus gradually develop
devotional service in Kåñëa consciousness and become so absorbed in
transcendental service that they no longer desire elevation to any of the
material planets, nor do they even want to be transferred to any spiritual
planet. They only want Kåñëa’s association and nothing else. Such great souls in
Kåñëa consciousness attain the highest perfection of life. In other words, they
are the supreme souls.

TRANSLATION
From the highest planet in the material world down to the lowest, all are places
of misery wherein repeated birth and death take place. But one who attains to My
abode, O son of Kunté, never takes birth again.

PURPORT
All kinds of yogés—karma, jïäna, haöha, etc.—eventually have to attain
devotional perfection in bhakti-yoga, or Kåñëa consciousness, before they can go
to Kåñëa’s transcendental abode and never return. Those who attain the highest
material planets or the planets of the demigods are again subjected to repeated
birth and death. As persons on earth are elevated to higher planets, people in
higher planets such as Brahmaloka, Candraloka and Indraloka fall down to earth.
The practice of sacrifice called païcägni-vidyä, recommended in the Kaöha
Upaniñad, enables one to achieve Brahmaloka, but if, in Brahmaloka, one does not
cultivate Kåñëa consciousness, then he must return to earth. Those who progress
in Kåñëa consciousness in the higher planets are gradually elevated to higher
and higher planets and at the time of universal devastation are transferred to
the eternal spiritual kingdom. When there is devastation of this material
universe, Brahmä and his devotees, who are constantly engaged in Kåñëa
consciousness, are all transferred to the spiritual universe and to specific
spiritual planets according to their desires.

TRANSLATION
By human calculation, a thousand ages taken together is the duration of Brahmä’s
one day. And such also is the duration of his night.

PURPORT
The duration of the material universe is limited. It is manifested in cycles of
kalpas. A kalpa is a day of Brahmä, and one day of Brahmä consists of a thousand
cycles of four yugas or ages: Satya, Tretä, Dväpara, and Kali. The cycle of
Satya is characterized by virtue, wisdom and religion, there being practically
no ignorance and vice, and the yuga lasts 1,728,000 years. In the Tretä-yuga
vice is introduced, and this yuga lasts 1,296,000 years. In the Dväpara-yuga
there is an even greater decline in virtue and religion, vice increasing, and
this yuga lasts 864,000 years. And finally in Kali-yuga (the yuga we have now
been experiencing over the past 5,000 years) there is an abundance of strife,
ignorance, irreligion and vice, true virtue being practically nonexistent, and
this yuga lasts 432,000 years. In Kali-yuga vice increases to such a point that
at the termination of the yuga the Supreme Lord Himself appears as the Kalki
avatara, vanquishes the demons, saves His devotees, and commences another
Satya-yuga. Then the process is set rolling again. These four yugas, rotating a
thousand times, comprise one day of Brahmä, the creator god, and the same number
comprise one night. Brahmä lives one hundred of such “years” and then dies.
These “hundred years” by earth calculations total to 311 trillion and 40 million
earth years. By these calculations the life of Brahmä seems fantastic and
interminable, but from the viewpoint of eternity it is as brief as a lightning
flash. In the causal ocean there are innumerable Brahmäs rising and disappearing
like bubbles in the Atlantic. Brahmä and his creation are all part of the
material universe, and therefore they are in constant flux.

In the material universe not even Brahmä is free from the process of birth, old
age, disease and death. Brahmä, however, is directly engaged in the service of
the Supreme Lord in the management of this universe—therefore he at once attains
liberation. Elevated sannyäsés are promoted to Brahmä’s particular planet,
Brahmaloka, which is the highest planet in the material universe and which
survives all the heavenly planets in the upper strata of the planetary system,
but in due course Brahmä and all inhabitants of Brahmaloka are subject to death,
according to the law of material nature.

TRANSLATION
When Brahmä’s day is manifest, this multitude of living entities comes into
being, and at the arrival of Brahmä’s night they are all annihilated.

PURPORT
The less intelligent jévas try to remain within this material world and are
accordingly elevated and degraded in the various planetary systems. During the
daytime of Brahmä they exhibit their activities, and at the coming of Brahmä’s
night they are annihilated. In the day they receive various bodies for material
activities, and at night these bodies perish. The jévas (individual souls)
remain compact in the body of Viñëu and again and again are manifest at the
arrival of Brahmä’s day. When Brahmä’s life is finally finished, they are all
annihilated and remain unmanifest for millions and millions of years. Finally,
when Brahmä is born again in another millennium, they are again manifest. In
this way the jévas are captivated by the material world. However, those
intelligent beings who take to Kåñëa consciousness and chant Hare Kåñëa, Hare
Räma in devotional service transfer themselves, even in this life, to the
spiritual planet of Kåñëa and become eternally blissful there, not being subject
to such rebirths.

PURPORT
Kåñëa’s superior spiritual energy is transcendental and eternal. It is beyond
all the changes of material nature, which is manifest and annihilated during the
days and nights of Brahmä. Kåñëa’s superior energy is completely opposite in
quality to material nature. Superior and inferior nature are explained in the
Seventh Chapter.

That supreme abode is called unmanifested and infallible, and it is the supreme

PURPORT
The supreme abode of the Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, is described in the
Brahma-saàhitä as cintämaëi-dhäma, a place where all desires are fulfilled. The
supreme abode of Lord Kåñëa known as Goloka Våndävana is full of palaces made of
touchstone. There are also trees which are called “desire trees” that supply any
type of eatable upon demand, and there are cows known as surabhi cows which
supply a limitless supply of milk. In this abode, the Lord is served by hundreds
of thousands of goddesses of fortune (Lakñmés), and He is called Govinda, the
primal Lord and the cause of all causes. The Lord is accustomed to blow His
flute (venum kvanantam). His transcendental form is the most attractive in all
the worlds—His eyes are like the lotus petals and the color of His body like
clouds. He is so attractive that His beauty excels that of thousands of cupids.
He wears saffron cloth, a garland around His neck and a peacock feather in His
hair. In the Gétä Lord Krñëa gives only a small hint of His personal abode
(Goloka Våndävana) which is the supermost planet in the spiritual kingdom. A
vivid description is given in the Brahma-saàhitä. Vedic literature states that
there is nothing superior to the abode of the Supreme Godhead, and that that
abode is the ultimate destination. When one attains to it, he never returns to
the material world. Kåñëa’s supreme abode and Kåñëa Himself are nondifferent,
being of the same quality. On this earth, Våndävana, ninety miles southeast of
Delhi, is a replica of that supreme Goloka Våndävana located in the spiritual
sky. When Kåñëa descended on this earth, He sported on that particular tract of
land known as Våndävana in the district of Mathurä, India.

TRANSLATION
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is greater than all, is attainable by
unalloyed devotion. Although He is present in His abode, He is all-pervading,
and everything is situated within Him.

PURPORT
It is here clearly stated that the supreme destination from which there is no
return is the abode of Kåñëa, the Supreme Person. The Brahma-saàhitä describes
this supreme abode as änanda-cinmaya-rasa, a place where everything is full of
spiritual bliss. Whatever variegatedness is manifest there is all of the quality
of spiritual bliss—there is nothing material. All variegatedness is expanded as
the spiritual expansion of the Supreme Godhead Himself, for the manifestation
there is totally of the spiritual energy, as explained in Chapter Seven. As far
as this material world is concerned, although the Lord is always in His supreme
abode, He is nonetheless all-pervading by His material energy. So by His
spiritual and material energies He is present everywhere—both in the material
and in the spiritual universes. Yasyäntaùsthäni means that everything is
sustained by Him, whether it be spiritual or material energy.

It is clearly stated here that only by bhakti, or devotional service, can one
enter into the Vaikuëöha (spiritual) planetary system. In all the Vaikuëöhas
there is only one Supreme Godhead, Kåñëa, who has expanded Himself into millions
and millions of plenary expansions. These plenary expansions are four-armed, and
they preside over the innumerable spiritual planets. They are known by a variety
of names—Puruñottama, Trivikrama, Keçava, Mädhava, Aniruddha, Håñékeça,
Saìkarñaëa, Pradyumna, Çrédhara, Väsudeva, Dämodara, Janärdana, Näräyaëa,
Vämana, Padmanäbha, etc. These plenary expansions are likened unto the leaves of
a tree, and the main tree is likened to Kåñëa. Kåñëa, dwelling in Goloka
Våndävana, His supreme abode, systematically conducts all affairs of both
universes (material and spiritual) without a flaw by power of His
all-pervasiveness.

TRANSLATION
O best of the Bhäratas, I shall now explain to you the different times at which,
passing away from this world, one does or does not come back.

PURPORT
The unalloyed devotees of the Supreme Lord who are totally surrendered souls do
not care when they leave their bodies or by what method. They leave everything
in Kåñëa’s hands and so easily and happily return to Godhead. But those who are
not unalloyed devotees and who depend instead on such methods of spiritual
realization as karma-yoga, jïäna-yoga, haöha-yoga, etc., must leave the body at
a suitable time and thereby be assured whether or not they will return to the
world of birth and death.

If the yogé is perfect, he can select the time and place for leaving this
material world, but if he is not so perfect, then he has to leave at nature’s
will. The most suitable time to leave the body and not return is being explained
by the Lord in these verses. According to Äcärya Baladeva Vidyäbhüñaëa, the
Sanskrit word käla used herein refers to the presiding deity of time.

TRANSLATION
Those who know the Supreme Brahman pass away from the world during the influence
of the fiery god, in the light, at an auspicious moment, during the fortnight of
the moon and the six months when the sun travels in the north.

PURPORT
When fire, light, day and moon are mentioned, it is to be understood that over
all of them there are various presiding deities who make arrangements for the
passage of the soul. At the time of death, the jéva sets forth on the path to a
new life. If one leaves the body at the time designated above, either accidently
or by arrangement, it is possible for him to attain the impersonal brahmajyoti.
Mystics who are advanced in yoga practice can arrange the time and place to
leave the body. Others have no control—if by accident they leave at an
auspicious moment, then they will not return to the cycle of birth and death,
but if not, then there is every possibility that they will have to return.
However, for the pure devotee in Kåñëa consciousness, there is no fear of
returning, whether he leaves the body at an auspicious or inauspicious moment,
by accident or arrangement.

The mystic who passes away from this world during the smoke, the night, the

who reaches the moon planet, again comes back.

PURPORT
In the Third Canto of Çrémad-Bhägavatam we are informed that those who are
expert in fruitive activities and sacrificial methods on earth attain to the
moon at death. These elevated souls live on the moon for about 10,000 years (by
demigod calculations) and enjoy life by drinking soma-rasa. They eventually
return to earth. This means that on the moon there are higher classes of living
beings, though they may not be perceived by the gross senses.

According to the Vedas, there are two ways of passing from this world—one in

when one passes in darkness, he returns.

PURPORT
The same description of departure and return is quoted by Äcärya Baladeva
Vidyäbhüñaëa from the Chandogya Upaniñad. In such a way, those who are fruitive
laborers and philosophical speculators from time immemorial are constantly going
and coming. Actually they do not attain ultimate salvation, for they do not
surrender to Kåñëa.

The devotees who know these two paths, O Arjuna, are never bewildered. Therefore

PURPORT

Kåñëa is here advising Arjuna that he should not be disturbed by the different
paths the soul can take when leaving the material world. A devotee of the
Supreme Lord should not worry whether he will depart either by arrangement or by
accident. The devotee should be firmly established in Krñëa consciousness and
chant Hare Kåñëa. He should know that concern over either of these two paths is
troublesome. The best way to be absorbed in Kåñëa consciousness is to be always
dovetailed in His service, and this will make one’s path to the spiritual
kingdom safe, certain, and direct. The word yoga-yukta is especially significant
in this verse. One who is firm in yoga is constantly engaged in Kåñëa
consciousness in all his activities. Çré Rüpa Gosvämé advises that one should be
unattached in the material world and that all affairs should be steeped in Kåñëa
consciousness. In this way one attains perfection. Therefore the devotee is not
disturbed by these descriptions because he knows that his passage to the supreme
abode is guaranteed by devotional service.

TRANSLATION
A person who accepts the path of devotional service is not bereft of the results
derived from studying the Vedas, performing austere sacrifices, giving charity
or pursuing philosophical and fruitive activities. At the end he reaches the
supreme abode.

PURPORT
This verse is the summation of the Seventh and Eighth Chapters, particularly as
the chapters deal with Kåñëa consciousness and devotional service. One has to
study the Vedas under the guidance of the spiritual master and undergo many
austerities and penances while living under his care. A brahmacäré has to live
in the home of the spiritual master just like a servant, and he must beg alms
from door to door and bring them to the spiritual master. He takes food only
under the master’s order, and if the master neglects to call the student for
food that day, the student fasts. These are some of the Vedic principles for
observing brahmacarya.

After the student studies the Vedas under the master for a period from five to
twenty years, he may become a man of perfect character. Study of the Vedas is
not meant for the recreation of armchair speculators, but for the formation of
character. After this training, the brahmacäré is allowed to enter into
household life and marry. When he is a householder, he also has to perform many
sacrifices and strive for further enlightenment. Then after retiring from
household life, upon accepting the order of vänaprastha, he undergoes severe
penances, such as living in forests, dressing with tree bark, not shaving, etc.
By carrying out the orders of brahmacäré, householder, vänaprastha and finally
sannyäsa, one becomes elevated to the perfectional stage of life. Some are then
elevated to the heavenly kingdoms, and when they become even more advanced they
are liberated in the spiritual sky, either in the impersonal brahmajyoti or in
the Vaikuëöha planets or Kåñëaloka. This is the path outlined by Vedic
literatures.

The beauty of Kåñëa consciousness, however, is that by one stroke, by engaging
in devotional service, one can surpass all rituals of the different orders of
life.

One should try to understand the Seventh and Eighth Chapters of the Gétä not by
scholarship or mental speculation, but by hearing them in association with pure
devotees. Chapters Six through Twelve are the essence of the Gétä. If one is
fortunate to understand the Gétä—especially these middle six chapters—in the
association of devotees, then his life at once becomes glorified beyond all
penances, sacrifices, charities, speculations, etc. One should hear the Gétä
from the devotee because at the beginning of the Fourth Chapter it is stated
that the Géta can only be perfectly understood by devotees. Hearing the Gétä
from devotees, not from mental speculators, is called faith. Through association
of devotees, one is placed in devotional service, and by this service Kåñëa’s
activities, form, pastimes, name, etc., become clear, and all misgivings are
dispelled. Then once doubts are removed, the study of the Gétä becomes extremely
pleasurable, and one develops a taste and feeling for Kåñëa consciousness. In
the advanced stage, one falls completely in love with Kåñëa, and that is the
beginning of the highest perfectional stage of life which prepares the devotee’s
transferral to Kåñëa’s abode in the spiritual sky, Goloka Våndävana, where the
devotee enters into eternal happiness.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Eighth Chapter of the
Çrémad-Bhagavad-gétä in the matter of Attaining the Supreme.

The Most Confidential Knowledge

miserable material existence.

TRANSLATION
The Supreme Lord said: My dear Arjuna, because you are never envious of Me, I
shall impart to you this most secret wisdom, knowing which you shall be relieved
of the miseries of material existence.

PURPORT
As a devotee hears more and more about the Supreme Lord, he becomes enlightened.
This hearing process is recommended in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam: “The messages of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead are full of potencies, and these potencies
can be realized if topics regarding the Supreme Godhead are discussed amongst
devotees. This cannot be achieved by the association of mental speculators or
academic scholars, for it is realized knowledge.”

The devotees are constantly engaged in the Supreme Lord’s service. The Lord
understands the mentality and sincerity of a particular living entity who is
engaged in Kåñëa consciousness and gives him the intelligence to understand the
science of Kåñëa in the association of the devotees. Discussion of Kåñëa is very
potent, and if a fortunate person has such association and tries to assimilate
the knowledge, then he will surely make advancement toward spiritual
realization. Lord Kåñëa, in order to encourage Arjuna to higher and higher
elevation in His potent service, describes in this Ninth Chapter matters more
confidential than any He has already disclosed.

The very beginning of Bhagavad-gétä, the First Chapter, is more or less an
introduction to the rest of the book; and in the Second and Third Chapters, the
spiritual knowledge described is called confidential. Topics discussed in the
Seventh and Eighth Chapters are specifically related to devotional service, and
because they bring enlightenment in Kåñëa consciousness, they are called more
confidential. But the matters which are described in the Ninth Chapter deal with
unalloyed, pure devotion. Therefore this is called the most confidential. One
who is situated in the most confidential knowledge of Kåñëa is naturally
transcendental; he therefore has no material pangs, although he is in the
material world. In the Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu it is said that although one who
has a sincere desire to render loving service to the Supreme Lord is situated in
the conditional state of material existence, he is to be considered liberated.
Similarly, we shall find in the Bhagavad-gétä, Tenth Chapter, that anyone who is
engaged in that way is a liberated person.

Now this first verse has specific significance. Knowledge (idaà jïänam) refers
to pure devotional service, which consists of nine different activities:
hearing, chanting, remembering, serving, worshiping, praying, obeying,
maintaining friendship and surrendering everything. By the practice of these
nine elements of devotional service one is elevated to spiritual consciousness,
Kåñëa consciousness. At the time when one’s heart is cleared of the material
contamination, one can understand this science of Kåñëa. Simply to understand
that a living entity is not material is not sufficient. That may be the
beginning of spiritual realization, but one should recognize the difference
between activities of the body and spiritual activities by which one understands
that he is not the body.

In the Seventh Chapter we have already discussed the opulent potency of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, His different energies, the inferior and
superior natures, and all this material manifestation. Now in Chapters Nine and
Ten the glories of the Lord will be delineated.

The Sanskrit word anasüyave in this verse is also very significant. Generally
the commentators, even if they are highly scholarly, are all envious of Kåñëa,
the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Even the most erudite scholars write on
Bhagavad-gétä very inaccurately. Because they are envious of Kåñëa, their
commentaries are useless. The commentaries given by devotees of the Lord are
bona fide. No one can explain Bhagavad-gétä, or give perfect knowledge of Kåñëa
if he is envious. One who criticizes the character of Kåñëa without knowing Him
is a fool. So such commentaries should be very carefully avoided. For one who
understands that Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the pure and
transcendental Personality, these chapters will be very beneficial.

TRANSLATION
This knowledge is the king of education, the most secret of all secrets. It is
the purest knowledge, and because it gives direct perception of the self by
realization, it is the perfection of religion. It is everlasting, and it is
joyfully performed.

PURPORT
This chapter of Bhagavad-gétä is called the king of education because it is the
essence of all doctrines and philosophies explained before. There are seven
principal philosophers in India: Gautama, Kaëäda, Kapila, Yäjïavalkya, Çäëòilya,
Vaiçvänara, and, finally, Vyäsadeva, the author of the Vedänta-sütra. So there
is no dearth of knowledge in the field of philosophy or transcendental
knowledge. Now the Lord says that this Ninth Chapter is the king of all such
knowledge, the essence of all knowledge that can be derived from the study of
the Vedas and different kinds of philosophy. It is the most confidential because
confidential or transcendental knowledge involves understanding the difference
between the soul and the body. And the king of all confidential knowledge
culminates in devotional service.

Generally, people are not educated in this confidential knowledge; they are
educated in external knowledge. As far as ordinary education is concerned,
people are involved with so many departments: politics, sociology, physics,
chemistry, mathematics, astronomy, engineering, etc. There are so many
departments of knowledge all over the world and many huge universities, but
there is, unfortunately, no university or educational institution where the
science of the spirit soul is instructed. Yet the soul is the most important
part of this body; without the presence of the soul, the body has no value.
Still people are placing great stress on the bodily necessities of life, not
caring for the vital soul.

The Bhagavad-gétä, especially from the Second Chapter on, stresses the
importance of the soul. In the very beginning, the Lord says that this body is
perishable and that the soul is not perishable. That is a confidential part of
knowledge: simply knowing that spirit soul is different from this body and that
its nature is immutable, indestructible and eternal. But that gives no positive
information about the soul. Sometimes people are under the impression that the
soul is different from the body and that when the body is finished, or one is
liberated from the body, the soul remains in a void and becomes impersonal. But
actually that is not the fact. How can the soul, which is so active within this
body, be inactive after being liberated from the body? It is always active. If
it is eternal, then it is eternally active, and its activities in the spiritual
kingdom are the most confidential part of spiritual knowledge. These activities
of the spirit soul are therefore indicated here as constituting the king of all
knowledge, the most confidential part of all knowledge.

This knowledge is the purest form of all activities, as is explained in Vedic
literature. In the Padma Puräëa, man’s sinful activities have been analyzed and
are shown to be the results of sin after sin. Those who are engaged in fruitive
activities are entangled in different stages and forms of sinful reactions. For
instance, when the seed of a particular tree is sown, the tree does not appear
immediately to grow; it takes some time. It is first a small, sprouting plant,
then it assumes the form of a tree, then it flowers, bears fruit, and, when it
is complete, the flowers and fruits are enjoyed by persons who have sown the
seed of the tree. Similarly, a man performs a sinful act, and like a seed it
takes time to fructify. There are different stages. The sinful action may have
already stopped within the individual, but the results or the fruit of that
sinful action are still enjoyed. There are sins which are still in the form of a
seed, and there are others which are already fructified and are giving us fruit,
which we are enjoying as distress and pain, as explained in the twentieth verse
of the Seventh Chapter.

A person who has completely ended the reactions of all sinful activities and who
is fully engaged in pious activities, being freed from the duality of this
material world, becomes engaged in devotional service to the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, Kåñëa. In other words, those who are actually engaged in the
devotional service of the Supreme Lord are already freed from all reactions. For
those who are engaged in the devotional service of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, all sinful reactions, whether fructified, in the stock, or in the form
of a seed, gradually vanish. Therefore the purifying potency of devotional
service is very strong, and it is called pavitram uttamam, the purest. Uttamam
means transcendental. Tamas means this material world or darkness, and uttamam
means that which is transcendental to material activities. Devotional activities
are never to be considered material, although sometimes it appears that devotees
are engaged just like ordinary men. One who can see and is familiar with
devotional service, however, will know that they are not material activities.
They are all spiritual and devotional, uncontaminated by the material modes of
nature.

It is said that the execution of devotional service is so perfect that one can
perceive the results directly. This direct result is actually perceived, and we
have practical experience that any person who is chanting the holy names of
Kåñëa (Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma,
Räma Räma, Hare Hare) in course of time feels some transcendental pleasure and
very quickly becomes purified of all material contamination. This is actually
seen. Furthermore, if one engages not only in hearing but in trying to broadcast
the message of devotional activities as well, or if he engages himself in
helping the missionary activities of Kåñëa consciousness, he gradually feels
spiritual progress. This advancement in spiritual life does not depend on any
kind of previous education or qualification. The method itself is so pure that
by simply engaging in it one becomes pure.

In the Vedänta-sütra this is also described in the following words: prakäçaç ca
karmaëy abhyäsät. “Devotional service is so potent that simply by engaging in
the activities of devotional service, one becomes enlightened without a doubt.”
Närada, who happened to be the son of a maidservant, had no education, nor was
he born into a high family. But when his mother was engaged in serving great
devotees, Närada also became engaged, and sometimes, in the absence of his
mother, he would serve the great devotees himself. Närada personally says, “Once
only, by their permission, I took the remnants of their food, and by so doing
all my sins were at once eradicated. Thus being engaged, I became purified in
heart, and at that time the very nature of the transcendentalist became
attractive to me.” (Bhäg. 1.5.25) Närada tells his disciple Vyäsadeva that in a
previous life he was engaged as a boy servant of purified devotees during four
months of their stay and that he was intimately associating with them. Sometimes
those sages left remnants of food on their dishes, and the boy, who would wash
their dishes, wanted to taste the remnants. So he asked the great devotees
whether he could eat them, and they gave their permission. Närada then ate those
remnants and consequently became freed from all sinful reactions. As he went on
eating, he gradually became as purehearted as the sages, and he gradually
developed the same taste. The great devotees relished the taste of unceasing
devotional service of the Lord, hearing, chanting, etc., and by developing the
same taste, Närada wanted also to hear and chant the glories of the Lord. Thus
by associating with the sages, he developed a great desire for devotional
service. Therefore he quotes from the Vedänta-sütra (prakäçaç ca karmaëy
abhyäsät): If one is engaged simply in the acts of devotional service,
everything is revealed to him automatically, and he can understand. This is
called prakäçaù, directly perceived.

Närada was actually a son of a maidservant. He had no opportunity to go to
school. He was simply assisting his mother, and fortunately his mother rendered
some service to the devotees. The child Närada also got the opportunity and
simply by association achieved the highest goal of all religions, devotional
service. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam it is said that religious people generally do
not know that the highest perfection of religion is the attainment of the stage
of devotional service. Generally Vedic knowledge is required for the
understanding of the path of self-realization. But here, although he was not
educated in the Vedic principle, Närada acquired the highest results of Vedic
study. This process is so potent that even without performing the religious
process regularly, one can be raised to the highest perfection. How is this
possible? This is also confirmed in Vedic literature: äcäryavän puruño veda. One
who is in association with great äcäryas, even if he is not educated or has not
studied the Vedas, can become familiar with all the knowledge necessary for
realization.

The process of devotional service is a very happy one. Why? Devotional service
consists of çravaëaà kértanaà viñëoù, so one can simply hear the chanting of the
glories of the Lord or can attend philosophical lectures on transcendental
knowledge given by authorized äcäryas. Simply by sitting, one can learn; then
one can eat the remnants of the food offered to God, nice palatable dishes. In
every state devotional service is joyful. One can execute devotional service
even in the most poverty-stricken condition. The Lord says, patraà puñpaà
phalam: He is ready to accept from the devotee any kind of offering, never mind
what. Even a leaf, a flower, a bit of fruit, or a little water, which are all
available in every part of the world, can be offered by any person, regardless
of social position, and will be accepted if offered with love. There are many
instances in history. Simply by tasting the tulasé leaves offered to the lotus
feet of the Lord, great sages like Sanatkumära became great devotees. Therefore
the devotional process is very nice, and it can be executed in a happy mood. God
accepts only the love with which things are offered to Him.

It is said here that this devotional service is eternally existing. It is not as
the Mäyävädé philosophers claim. They sometimes take to so-called devotional
service, and as long as they are not liberated they continue their devotional
service, but at the end, when they become liberated, they “become one with God.”
Such temporary time-serving devotional service is not accepted as pure
devotional service. Actual devotional service continues even after liberation.
When the devotee goes to the spiritual planet in the kingdom of God, he is also
engaged there in serving the Supreme Lord. He does not try to become one with
the Supreme Lord.

As it will be seen, actual devotional service begins after liberation. So in
Bhagavad-gétä it is said, brahma-bhüta. After being liberated, or being situated
in the Brahman position, one’s devotional service begins. By executing
devotional service, one can understand the Supreme Lord. No one can understand
the Supreme Personality of Godhead by executing karma-yoga, jïäna, or
añöäìga-yoga or any other yoga independantly. Without coming to the stage of
devotional service, one cannot understand what is the Personality of Godhead. In
the Çrémad-Bhägavatam it is also confirmed that when one becomes purified by
executing the process of devotional service, especially by hearing
Çrémad-Bhägavatam or Bhagavad-gétä from realized souls, then he can understand
the science of Kåñëa or the science of God. Evaà prasanna-manaso
bhagavad-bhakti-yogataù. When one’s heart is cleared of all nonsense, then one
can understand what God is. Thus the process of devotional service, of Kåñëa
consciousness, is the king of all education and the king of all confidential
knowledge. It is the purest form of religion, and it can be executed joyfully
without difficulty. Therefore one should adopt it.

TRANSLATION
Those who are not faithful on the path of devotional service cannot attain Me, O
conqueror of foes, but return to birth and death in this material world.

PURPORT
The faithless cannot accomplish this process of devotional service; that is the
purport of this verse. Faith is created by association with devotees.
Unfortunate people, even after hearing all the evidence of Vedic literature from
great personalities, still have no faith in God. They are hesitant and cannot
stay fixed in the devotional service of the Lord. Thus faith is a most important
factor for progress in Kåñëa consciousness. In the Caitanya-caritämåta it is
said that one should have complete conviction that simply by serving the Supreme
Lord Çré Kåñëa he can achieve all perfection. That is called real faith. In the
Çrémad-Bhägavatam (3.4.12) it is stated that by giving water to the root of a
tree, its branches, twigs and leaves become satisfied, and by supplying food to
the stomach all the senses of the body become satisfied, and, similarly, by
engaging in the transcendental service of the Supreme Lord, all the demigods and
all the living entities automatically become satisfied.

After reading Bhagavad-gétä one should promptly come to the conclusion of
Bhagavad-gétä: one should give up all other engagements and adopt the service of
the Supreme Lord, Kåñëa, the Personality of Godhead. If one is convinced of this
philosophy of life, that is faith. Now the development of that faith is the
process of Kåñëa consciousness.

There are three divisions of Kåñëa conscious men. In the third class are those
who have no faith. If they are engaged in devotional service officially, for
some ulterior purpose, they cannot achieve the highest perfectional stage. Most
probably they will slip, after some time. They may become engaged, but because
they haven’t complete conviction and faith, it is very difficult for them to
continue in Kåñëa consciousness. We have practical experience in discharging our
missionary activity that some people come and apply themselves to the Kåñëa
consciousness with some hidden motive, and as soon as they are economically a
little well-situated, they give up this process and take to their old ways
again. It is only by faith that one can advance in Kåñëa consciousness. As far
as the development of faith is concerned, one who is well versed in the
literatures of devotional service and has attained the stage of firm faith is
called a first-class person in Kåñëa consciousness. And in the second class are
those who are not very advanced in understanding the devotional scriptures but
who automatically have firm faith that Kåñëa bhakti or service to Kåñëa is the
best course and so in good faith have taken it up. Thus they are superior to the
third class who have neither perfect knowledge of the scriptures nor good faith
but by association and simplicity are trying to follow. The third-class person
in Kåñëa consciousness may fall down, but when one is in the second class or
first class, he does not fall down. One in the first class will surely make
progress and achieve the result at the end. As far as the third-class person in
Kåñëa consciousness is concerned, although he has faith in the conviction that
devotional service to Kåñëa is very good, he has no knowledge of Kåñëa through
the scriptures like Çrémad-Bhägavatam and Bhagavad-gétä. Sometimes these
third-class persons in Kåñëa consciousness have some tendency toward karma-yoga
and jïäna-yoga, and sometimes they are disturbed, but as soon as the infection
of karma-yoga or jïäna-yoga is vanquished, they become second-class or
first-class persons in Kåñëa consciousness. Faith in Kåñëa is also divided into
three stages and described in Çrémad-Bhägavatam. First-class attachment,
second-class attachment, and third-class attachment are also explained in
Çrémad-Bhägavatam in the Eleventh Canto. Those who have no faith even after
hearing about Kåñëa and the excellence of devotional service, who think that it
is simply eulogy, find the path very difficult, even if they are supposedly
engaged in devotional service. For them there is very little hope in gaining
perfection. Thus faith is very important in the discharge of devotional service.

TRANSLATION
By Me, in My unmanifested form, this entire universe is pervaded. All beings are
in Me, but I am not in them.

PURPORT
The Supreme Personality of Godhead is not perceivable through the gross material
senses. It is said that Lord Çré Kåñëa’s name, fame, pastimes, etc., cannot be
understood by material senses. Only to one who is engaged in pure devotional
service under proper guidance is He revealed. In the Brahma-saàhitä it is
stated, premäïjanacchurita.… One can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
Govinda, always within himself and outside himself if he has developed the
transcendental loving attitude towards Him. Thus for people in general He is not
visible. Here it is said that although He is all-pervading, everywhere present,
He is yet not conceivable by the material senses. But actually, although we
cannot see Him, everything is resting in Him. As we have discussed in the
Seventh Chapter, the entire material cosmic manifestation is only a combination
of His two different energies, the superior spiritual energy and the inferior
material energy. Just as the sunshine is spread all over the universe, the
energy of the Lord is spread all over the creation, and everything is resting in
that energy.

Yet one should not conclude that because He is spread all over He has lost His
personal existence. To refute such argument the Lord says, “I am everywhere, and
everything is in Me, but still I am aloof.” For example, a king heads a
government which is but the manifestation of the king’s energy; the different
governmental departments are nothing but the energies of the king, and each
department is resting on the king’s power. But still one cannot expect the king
to be present in every department personally. That is a crude example.
Similarly, all the manifestations that we see, and everything that exists both
in this material world and in the spiritual world, are resting on the energy of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The creation takes place by the diffusion of
His different energies, and, as is stated in the Bhagavad-gétä, He is everywhere
present by His personal representation, the diffusion of His different energies.

TRANSLATION
And yet everything that is created does not rest in Me. Behold My mystic
opulence! Although I am the maintainer of all living entities, and although I am
everywhere, still My Self is the very source of creation.

PURPORT
The Lord says that everything is resting on Him. This should not be
misunderstood. The Lord is not directly concerned with the maintenance and
sustenance of this material manifestation. Sometimes we see a picture of Atlas
holding the globe on his shoulders; he seems to be very tired, holding this
great earthly planet. Such an image should not be entertained in connection with
Kåñëa’s upholding this created universe. He says that although everything is
resting on Him, still He is aloof. The planetary systems are floating in space,
and this space is the energy of the Supreme Lord. But He is different from
space. He is differently situated. Therefore the Lord says, “Although they are
situated on My inconceivable energy, still, as the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, I am aloof from them.” This is the inconceivable opulence of the Lord.

In the Vedic dictionary it is said, “The Supreme Lord is performing
inconceivably wonderful pastimes, displaying His energy. His person is full of
different potent energies, and His determination is itself actual fact. In this
way the Personality of Godhead is to be understood.” We may think to do
something, but there are so many impediments, and sometimes it is not possible
to do as we like. But when Kåñëa wants to do something, simply by His willing,
everything is performed so perfectly that one cannot imagine how it is being
done. The Lord explains this fact: although He is the maintainer and sustainer
of all material manifestation, He does not touch this material manifestation.
Simply by His supreme will everything is created, everything is sustained,
everything is maintained, and everything is annihilated. There is no difference
between His mind and Himself (as there is a difference between ourselves and our
present material mind) because He is absolute spirit. Simultaneously the Lord is
present in everything; yet the common man cannot understand how He is also
present personally. He is different from this material manifestation, yet
everything is resting on Him. This is explained here as yogam aiçvaram, the
mystic power of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

TRANSLATION
As the mighty wind, blowing everywhere, always rests in ethereal space know that
in the same manner all beings rest in Me.

PURPORT
For the ordinary person it is almost inconceivable how the huge material
creation is resting in Him. But the Lord is giving an example which may help us
to understand. Space is the biggest manifestation we can conceive. The cosmic
manifestation rests in space. Space permits the movement of even the atoms and
on up to the greatest planets, the sun and the moon. Although the sky (or wind
or air) is great, still it is situated within space. Space is not beyond the
sky.

Similarly, all the wonderful cosmic manifestations are existing by the supreme
will of God, and all of them are subordinate to that supreme will. As we
generally say, not a blade of grass moves without the will of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. Thus everything is moving under His will: by His will
everything is being created, everything is being maintained, and everything is
being annihilated. Still He is aloof from everything, as space is always aloof
from the activities of the atmosphere. In the Upaniñads, it is stated, “It is
out of the fear of the Supreme Lord that the wind is blowing.” In the Garga
Upaniñad also it is stated, “By the supreme order, under the superintendence of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the moon, the sun and the great planets are
moving.” In the Brahma-saàhitä this is also stated. There is also a description
of the movement of the sun, and it is said that the sun is considered to be one
of the eyes of the Supreme Lord and that it has immense potency to diffuse heat
and light. Still it is moving in its prescribed orbit by the order and the
supreme will of Govinda. So, from the Vedic literature we can find evidence that
this material manifestation, which appears to us to be very wonderful and great,
is under the complete control of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This will
be further explained in the later verses of this chapter.

TRANSLATION
O son of Kunté, at the end of the millennium every material manifestation enters
into My nature, and at the beginning of another millennium, by My potency I
again create.

PURPORT
The creation, maintenance and annihilation of this material cosmic manifestation
is completely dependant on the supreme will of the Personality of Godhead. “At
the end of the millennium” means at the death of Brahmä. Brahmä lives for one
hundred years, and his one day is calculated at 4,300,000,000 of our earthly
years. His night is of the same duration. His month consists of thirty such days
and nights, and his year of twelve months. After one hundred such years, when
Brahmä dies, the devastation or annihilation takes place; this means that the
energy manifested by the Supreme Lord is again wound up in Himself. Then again,
when there is need to manifest the cosmic world, it is done by His will:
“Although I am one, I shall become many.” This is the Vedic aphorism. He expands
Himself in this material energy, and the whole cosmic manifestation again takes
place.

TRANSLATION
The whole cosmic order is under Me. By My will it is manifested again and again,
and by My will it is annihilated at the end.

PURPORT
This matter is the manifestation of the inferior energy of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. This has already been explained several times. At the
creation, the material energy is let loose as mahat-tattva, into which the Lord
as His first Puruña incarnation, Mahä-Viñëu, enters. He lies within the Causal
Ocean and breathes out innumerable universes, and into each universe the Lord
again enters as Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu. Each universe is in that way created. He
still further manifests Himself as Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu, and that Viñëu enters
into everything—even into the minute atom. This fact is explained here. He
enters into everything.

Now, as far as the living entities are concerned, they are impregnated into this
material nature, and as a result of their past deeds they take different
positions. Thus the activities of this material world begin. The activities of
the different species of living beings are begun from the very moment of the
creation. It is not that all is evolved. The different species of life are
created immediately along with the universe. Men, animals, beasts,
birds—everything is simultaneously created, because whatever desires the living
entities had at the last annihilation are again manifested. It is clearly stated
here that the living entities have nothing to do with this process. The state of
being in their past life in the past creation is simply manifested again, and
all this is done simply by His will. This is the inconceivable potency of the
Supreme Personality of God. And after creating different species of life, He has
no connection with them. The creation takes place to accommodate the
inclinations of the various living entities, and so the Lord does not become
involved with it.

TRANSLATION
O Dhanaïjaya, all this work cannot bind Me. I am ever detached, seated as though
neutral.

PURPORT
One should not think, in this connection, that the Supreme Personality of
Godhead has no engagement. In His spiritual world He is always engaged. In the
Brahma-saàhitä it is stated: “He is always involved in His eternal, blissful,
spiritual activities, but He has nothing to do with these material activities.”
Material activities are being carried on by His different potencies. The Lord is
always neutral in the material activities of the created world. This neutrality
is explained here. Although He has control over every minute detail of matter,
He is sitting as if neutral. The example can be given of a high court judge
sitting on his bench. By his order so many things are happening: someone is
being hanged, someone is being put into jail, someone is awarded a huge amount
of wealth—but still he is neutral. He has nothing to do with all that gain and
loss. Similarly, the Lord is always neutral, although He has His hand in every
sphere of activity. In the Vedänta-sütra it is stated that He is not situated in
the dualities of this material world. He is transcendental to these dualities.
Nor is He attached to the creation and annihilation of this material world. The
living entities take their different forms in the various species of life
according to their past deeds, and the Lord doesn’t interfere with them.

TRANSLATION
This material nature is working under My direction, O son of Kunté, and it is
producing all moving and unmoving beings. By its rule this manifestation is
created and annihilated again and again.

PURPORT
It is clearly stated here that the Supreme Lord, although aloof from all the
activities of the material world, remains the supreme director. The Supreme Lord
is the supreme will and the background of this material manifestation, but the
management is being conducted by material nature. Kåñëa also states in
Bhagavad-gétä that of all the living entities in different forms and species, “I
am the Father.” The father gives seeds to the womb of the mother for the child,
and similarly the Supreme Lord by His mere glance injects all the living
entities into the womb of material nature, and they come out in their different
forms and species, according to their last desires and activities. All these
living entities, although born under the glance of the Supreme Lord, still take
their different bodies according to their past deeds and desires. So the Lord is
not directly attached to this material creation. He simply glances over material
nature; material nature is thus activated, and everything is created
immediately. Because He glances over material nature, there is undoubtedly
activity on the part of the Supreme Lord, but He has nothing to do with the
manifestation of the material world directly. This example is given in the
småti: when there is a fragrant flower before someone, the fragrance is touched
by the smelling power of the person, yet the smelling and the flower are
detached from one another. There is a similar connection between the material
world and the Supreme Personality of Godhead; actually He has nothing to do with
this material world, but He creates by His glance and ordains. In summary,
material nature, without the superintendence of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, cannot do anything. Yet the Supreme Personality is detached from all
material activities.

TRANSLATION
Fools deride Me when I descend in the human form. They do not know My

PURPORT
From the other explanations of the previous verses in this chapter, it is clear
that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although appearing like a human being,
is not a common man. The Personality of Godhead, who conducts the creation,
maintenance and annihilation of the complete cosmic manifestation, cannot be a
human being. Yet there are many foolish men who consider Kå,sëa to be merely a
powerful man and nothing more. Actually, He is the original Supreme Personality,
as is confirmed in the Brahma-saàhitä (içvaraù paramaù kåsëaù); He is the
Supreme Lord.

There are many éçvaras, controllers, and one appears greater than another. In
the ordinary management of affairs in the material world, we find some official
or director, and above him there is a secretary, and above him a minister, and
above him a president. Each of them is a controller, but one is controlled by
another. In the Brahma-saàhitä it is said that Kåñëa is the supreme controller;
there are many controllers undoubtedly both in the material and spiritual world,
but Kåñëa is the supreme controller (éçvaraù paramaù kåñëaù), and His body is
sac-cid-änanda, non-material.

Material bodies cannot perform the wonderful acts described in previous verses.
His body is eternal, blissful and full of knowledge. Although He is not a common
man, the foolish deride Him and consider Him to be a man. His body is called
here mänuñém because He is acting just like a man, a friend of Arjuna’s, a
politician involved in the Battle of Kurukñetra. In so many ways He is acting
just like an ordinary man, but actually His body is
sac-cid-änanda-vigraha—eternal bliss and knowledge absolute. This is confirmed
in the Vedic language also (sac-cid-änanda-rüpäya kåñëäya): “I offer my
obeisances unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, who is the eternal
blissful form of knowledge.” There are other descriptions in the Vedic language
also. Tam ekaà govindam: “You are Govinda, the pleasure of the senses and the
cows.” Sac-cid-änanda-vigraham: “And Your form is transcendental, full of
knowledge, bliss and eternality.”

Despite the transcendental qualities of Lord Kåñëa’s body, its full bliss and
knowledge, there are many so-called scholars and commentators of Bhagavad-gétä
who deride Kåñëa as an ordinary man. The scholar may be born an extraordinary
man due to his previous good work, but this conception of Çré Kåñëa is due to a
poor fund of knowledge. Therefore he is called müòha, for only foolish persons
consider Kåñëa to be an ordinary human being because they do not know the
confidential activities of the Supreme Lord and His different energies. They do
not know that Kåñëa’s body is a symbol of complete knowledge and bliss, that He
is the proprietor of everything that be and that He can award liberation to
anyone. Because they do not know that Kåñëa has so many transcendental
qualifications, they deride Him.

Nor do they know that the appearance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in
this material world is a manifestation of His internal energy. He is the master
of the material energy. As has been explained in several places (mama mäyä
duratyayä), He claims that the material energy, although very powerful, is under
His control, and whoever surrenders unto Him can get out of the control of this
material energy. If a soul surrendered to Kåñëa can get out of the influence of
material energy, then how can the Supreme Lord, who conducts the creation,
maintenance and annihilation of the whole cosmic nature, have a material body
like us? So this conception of Kåñëa is complete foolishness. Foolish persons,
however, cannot conceive that the Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, appearing just
like an ordinary man, can be the controller of all the atoms and of the gigantic
manifestation of the universal form. The biggest and the minutest are beyond
their conception, so they cannot imagine that a form like that of a human being
can simultaneously control the infinite and the minute. Actually although He is
controlling the infinite and the finite, He is apart from all this
manifestation. It is clearly stated concerning His yogam aiçvaram, His
inconceivable transcendental energy, that He can control the infinite and the
finite simultaneously and that He can remain aloof from them. Although the
foolish cannot imagine how Kåñëa, who appears just like a human being, can
control the infinite and the finite, those who are pure devotees accept this,
for they know that Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore they
completely surrender unto Him and engage in Kåñëa consciousness, devotional
service of the Lord.

There are many controversies amongst the impersonalists and the personalists
about the Lord’s appearance as a human being. But if we consult Bhagavad-gétä
and Çrémad-Bhägavatam, the authoritative texts for understanding the science of
Kåñëa, then we can understand that Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
He is not an ordinary man, although He appeared on this earth as an ordinary
human. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, First Canto, First Chapter, when the sages
inquire about the activities of Kåñëa, it is stated that His appearance as a man
bewilders the foolish. No human being could perform the wonderful acts that
Kåñëa performed while He was present on this earth. When Kåñëa appeared before
His father and mother, Vasudeva and Devaké, He appeared with four hands, but
after the prayers of the parents, He transformed Himself into an ordinary child.
His appearance as an ordinary human being is one of the features of His
transcendental body. In the Eleventh Chapter of the Gétä also it is stated,
tenaiva rüpeëa etc. Arjuna prayed to see again that form of four hands, and when
Kåñëa was thus petitioned by Arjuna, He again assumed His original form. All
these different features of the Supreme Lord are certainly not those of an
ordinary human being.

Some of those who deride Kåñëa, who are infected with the Mäyävädé philosophy,
quote the following verse from the Çrémad-Bhägavatam to prove that Kåñëa is just
an ordinary man: ahaà sarveñu bhüteñu bhütätmävasthitaù sadä: “The Supreme is
present in every living entity.” (Bhäg. 3.29.21) We should better take note of
this particular verse from the Vaiñëava äcäryas like Jéva Gosvämé instead of
following the interpretation of unauthorized persons who deride Kåñëa. Jéva
Gosvämé, commenting on this verse, says that Kåñëa, in His plenary expansion as
Paramätmä, is situated in the moving and the nonmoving entities as the
Supersoul, so any neophyte devotee who simply gives his attention to the
arca-mürti, the form of the Supreme Lord in the temple, and does not respect
other living entities is uselessly worshiping the form of the Lord in the
temple. There are three kinds of devotees of the Lord, and the neophyte is in
the lowest stage. The neophyte devotee gives more attention to the Deity in the
temple than to other devotees, so Jéva Gosvämé warns that this sort of mentality
should be corrected. A devotee should see that Kåñëa is present in everyone’s
heart as Paramätmä; therefore every body is the embodiment or the temple of the
Supreme Lord, and as such, as one offers respect to the temple of the Lord, he
should similarly properly respect each and every body in whom the Paramätmä
dwells. Everyone should therefore be given proper respect and should not be
neglected.

There are also many impersonalists who deride temple worship. They say that
since God is everywhere, why should one restrict himself to temple worship? But
if God is everywhere, is He not in the temple or in the Deity? Although the
personalist and the impersonalist will fight with one another perpetually, a
perfect devotee in Kåñëa consciousness knows that although Kåñëa is the Supreme
Personality, He is all-pervading, as is confirmed in the Brahma-saàhitä.
Although His personal abode is Goloka Våndävana and He is always staying there,
still, by His different manifestations of energy and by His plenary expansion,
He is present everywhere in all parts of the material and spiritual creation.

TRANSLATION
Those who are thus bewildered are attracted by demonic and atheistic views. In
that deluded condition, their hopes for liberation, their fruitive activities,
and their culture of knowledge are all defeated.

PURPORT
There are many devotees who assume themselves to be in Kåñëa consciousness and
devotional service but at heart do not accept the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, Kåñëa, as the Absolute Truth. For them, the fruit of devotional
service—going back to Godhead—will never be tasted. Similarly, those who are
engaged in fruitive, pious activities and who are ultimately hoping to be
liberated from this material entanglement will never be successful either
because they deride the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa. In other words,
persons who mock Kåñëa are to be understood to be demonic or atheistic. As
described in the Seventh Chapter of Bhagavad-gétä, such demonic miscreants never
surrender to Kåñëa. Therefore their mental speculations to arrive at the
Absolute Truth bring them to the false conclusion that the ordinary living
entity and Kåñëa are one and the same. With such a false conviction, they think
that the body of any human being is now simply covered by material nature and
that as soon as one is liberated from this material body there is no difference
between God and himself. This attempt to become one with Kåñëa will be baffled
because of delusion. Such atheistic and demoniac cultivation of spiritual
knowledge is always futile. That is the indication of this verse. For such
persons, cultivation of the knowledge in the Vedic literature, like the
Vedänta-sütra and the Upaniñads, is always baffled.

It is a great offense, therefore, to consider Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, to be an ordinary man. Those who do so are certainly deluded because
they cannot understand the eternal form of Kåñëa. In the Båhad-vaiñëava mantra
it is clearly stated that one who considers the body of Kåñëa to be material
should be driven out from all rituals and activities of the çruti. And if one by
chance sees his face, he should at once take bath in the Ganges to rid himself
of infection. People jeer at Kåñëa because they are envious of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. Their destiny is certainly to take birth after birth in
the species of atheistic and demoniac life. Perpetually, their real knowledge
will remain under delusion, and gradually they will regress to the darkest
region of creation.

O son of Påthä, those who are not deluded, the great souls, are under the

PURPORT
In this verse the description of mahätmä is clearly given. The first sign of the
mahätmä is that he is already situated in the divine nature. He is not under the
control of material nature. And how is this effected? That is explained in the
Seventh Chapter: one who surrenders unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Çré
Kåñëa, at once becomes freed from the control of material nature. That is the
qualification. One can become free from the control of material nature as soon
as he surrenders his soul to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is the
preliminary formula. Being marginal potency, as soon as the living entity is
freed from the control of material nature, he is put under the guidance of the
spiritual nature. The guidance of the spiritual nature is called daivéà
prakåtim, divine nature. So, when one is promoted in that way—by surrendering to
the Supreme Personality of Godhead—one attains to the stage of great soul,
mahätmä.

The mahätmä does not divert his attention to anything outside Kåñëa because he
knows perfectly well that Kåñëa is the original Supreme Person, the cause of all
causes. There is no doubt about it. Such a mahätmä, or great soul, develops
through association with other mahätmäs, pure devotees. Pure devotees are not
even attracted by Kåñëa’s other features, such as the four-armed Mahä-Viñëu.
They are simply attracted by the two-armed form of Kåñëa. Since they are not
attracted to other features of Kåñëa (what to speak of the demigods), they are
not concerned with any form of a demigod or of a human being. They only meditate
upon Kåñëa in Kåñëa consciousness. They are always engaged in the unswerving
service of the Lord in Kåñëa consciousness.

satatam—always; kértayantaù—chanting; mäm—Me; yatantaù ca—fully endeavoring

TRANSLATION
Always chanting My glories, endeavoring with great determination, bowing down
before Me, these great souls perpetually worship Me with devotion.

PURPORT
The mahätmä cannot be manufactured by rubber-stamping an ordinary man. His
symptoms are described here: a mahätmä is always engaged in chanting the glories
of the Supreme Lord Kåñëa, the Personality of Godhead. He has no other business.
He is always engaged in the glorification of the Lord. In other words, he is not
an impersonalist. When the question of glorification is there, one has to
glorify the Supreme Lord, praising His holy name, His eternal form, His
transcendental qualities and His uncommon pastimes. One has to glorify all these
things; therefore a mahätmä is attached to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

One who is attached to the impersonal feature of the Supreme Lord, the
brahmajyoti, is not described as mahätmä in the Bhagavad-gétä. He is described
in a different way in the next verse. The mahätmä is always engaged in different
activities of devotional service, as described in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, hearing
and chanting about Viñëu, not a demigod or human being. That is devotion:
çravaëaà kértanaà viñëoù, smaraëam, and remembering Him. Such a mahätmä has firm
determination to achieve at the ultimate end the association of the Supreme Lord
in any one of the five transcendental rasas. To achieve that success, he engages
all activities—mental, bodily and vocal, everything—in the service of the
Supreme Lord, Çré Kåñëa. That is called full Kåñëa consciousness.

In devotional service there are certain activities which are called determined,
such as fasting on certain days, like the eleventh day of the moon, Ekädaçé, and
on the appearance day of the Lord, etc. All these rules and regulations are
offered by the great äcäryas for those who are actually interested in getting
admission into the association of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the
transcendental world. The mahätmäs, great souls, strictly observe all these
rules and regulations, and therefore they are sure to achieve the desired
result.

As described in the second verse of this chapter, this devotional service is not
only easy, but it can be performed in a happy mood. One does not need to undergo
any severe penance and austerity. He can live this life in devotional service,
guided by an expert spiritual master, and in any position, either as a
householder or a sannyäsé, or a brahmacäré; in any position and anywhere in the
world, he can perform this devotional service to the Supreme Personality of
Godhead and thus become actually mahätmä, a great soul.

TRANSLATION
Others, who are engaged in the cultivation of knowledge, worship the Supreme
Lord as the one without a second, diverse in many, and in the universal form.

PURPORT
This verse is the summary of the previous verses. The Lord tells Arjuna that
those who are purely in Kåñëa consciousness and do not know anything other than
Kåñëa are called mahätmä; yet there are other persons who are not exactly in the
position of mahätmä but who worship Kåñëa also, in different ways. Some of them
are already described as the distressed, the financially destitute, the
inquisitive, and those who are engaged in the cultivation of knowledge. But
there are others who are still lower, and these are divided into three: 1) He
who worships himself as one with the Supreme Lord, 2) He who concocts some form
of the Supreme Lord and worships that, and 3) He who accepts the universal form,
the viçvarüpa of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and worships that. Out of
the above three, the lowest, those who worship themselves as the Supreme Lord,
thinking themselves to be monists, are most predominant. Such people think
themselves to be the Supreme Lord, and in this mentality they worship
themselves. This is also a type of God worship, for they can understand that
they are not the material body but are actually spiritual soul; at least, such a
sense is prominent. Generally the impersonalists worship the Supreme Lord in
this way. The second class includes the worshipers of the demigods, those who by
imagination consider any form to be the form of the Supreme Lord. And the third
class includes those who cannot conceive of anything beyond the manifestation of
this material universe. They consider the universe to be the supreme organism or
entity and worship that. The universe is also a form of the Lord.

But it is I who am the ritual, I the sacrifice, the offering to the ancestors,

PURPORT
The sacrifice known as jyotiñöoma is also Kåñëa, and He is also the mahä-yajïa
The oblations offered to the Pitåloka or the sacrifice performed to please the
Pitåloka, considered as a kind of drug in the form of clarified butter, is also
Kåñëa. The mantras chanted in this connection are also Kåñëa. And many other
commodities made with milk products for offering in the sacrifices are also
Kåñëa. The fire is also Kåñëa because fire is one of the five material elements
and is therefore claimed as the separated energy of Kåñëa. In other words, the
Vedic sacrifices recommended in the karma-käëòa division of the Vedas are in
total also Kåñëa. Or, in other words, those who are engaged in rendering
devotional service unto Kåñëa are to be understood to have performed all the
sacrifices recommended in the Vedas.

I am the father of this universe, the mother, the support, and the grandsire. I
am the object of knowledge, the purifier and the syllable om. I am also the Åk,
the Säma, and the Yajur [Vedas].

PURPORT
The entire cosmic manifestations, moving and nonmoving, are manifested by
different activities of Kåñëa’s energy. In the material existence we create
different relationships with different living entities who are nothing but
Kåñëa’s marginal energy, but under the creation of prakåti some of them appear
as our father, mother, grandfather, creator, etc., but actually they are parts
and parcels of Kåñëa. As such, these living entities who appear to be our
father, mother, etc., are nothing but Kåñëa. In this verse the word dhätä means
creator. Not only are our father and mother parts and parcels of Kåñëa, but
their creator, grandmother, and grandfather, etc., are also Kåñëa. Actually any
living entity, being part and parcel of Kåñëa, is Kåñëa. All the Vedas,
therefore, aim only toward Kåñëa. Whatever we want to know through the Vedas is
but a progressive step to understand Kåñëa. That subject matter which helps us
purify our constitutional position is especially Kåñëa. Similarly, the living
entity who is inquisitive to understand all Vedic principles is also part and
parcel of Kåñëa and as such is also Kåñëa. In all the Vedic mantras the word om,
called praëava, is a transcendental sound vibration and is also Kåñëa. And
because in all the hymns of the four Vedas, Säma, Yajur, Åg and Atharva, the
praëava or omkära is very prominent, it is understood to be Kåñëa.

TRANSLATION
I am the goal, the sustainer, the master, the witness, the abode, the refuge and
the most dear friend. I am the creation and the annihilation, the basis of
everything, the resting place and the eternal seed.

PURPORT
Gati means the destination where we want to go. But the ultimate goal is Kåñëa,
although people do not know it. One who does not know Kåñëa is misled, and his
so-called progressive march is either partial or hallucinatory. There are many
who make as their destination different demigods, and by rigid performance of
the strict respective methods they reach different planets known as Candraloka,
Süryaloka, Indraloka, Maharloka, etc. But all such lokas or planets, being
creations of Kåñëa, are simultaneously Kåñëa and not Kåñëa. Actually such
planets, being the manifestations of Kåñëa’s energy, are also Kåñëa, but
actually they only serve as a step forward for realization of Kåñëa. To approach
the different energies of Kåñëa is to approach Kåñëa indirectly. One should
directly approach Kåñëa, for that will save time and energy. For example, if
there is a possibility of going to the top of a building by the help of an
elevator, why should one go by the staircase, step by step? Everything is
resting on Kåñëa’s energy; therefore without Kåñëa’s shelter nothing can exist.
Kåñëa is the supreme ruler because everything belongs to Him and everything
exists on His energy. Kåñëa, being situated in everyone’s heart, is the supreme
witness. The residences, countries or planets on which we live are also Kåñëa.
Kåñëa is the ultimate goal of shelter, and as such one should take shelter of
Kåñëa either for protection or for annihilation of his distressed condition. And
whenever we have to take protection, we should know that our protection must be
a living force. Thus Kåñëa is the supreme living entity. Since Kåñëa is the
source of our generation, or the supreme father, no one can be a better friend
than Kåñëa, nor can anyone be a better well-wisher. Kåñëa is the original source
of creation and the ultimate rest after annihilation. Kåñëa is therefore the
eternal cause of all causes.

TRANSLATION
O Arjuna, I control heat, the rain and the drought. I am immortality, and I am
also death personified. Both being and nonbeing are in Me.

PURPORT
Kåñëa, by His different energies, diffuses heat and light through the agency of
electricity and the sun. During summer season it is Kåñëa who checks rain from
falling from the sky, and then, during the rainy season, He gives unceasing
torrents of rain. The energy which sustains us by prolonging the duration of our
life is Kåñëa, and Kåñëa meets us at the end as death. By analyzing all these
different energies of Kåñëa, one can acertain that for Kåñëa there is no
distinction between matter and spirit, or, in other words, He is both matter and
spirit. In the advanced stage of Kåñëa consciousness, one does not therefore
make such distinctions. He sees Kåñëa only in everything.

Since Kåñëa is both matter and spirit, the gigantic universal form comprising
all material manifestations is also Kåñëa, and His pastimes in Våndävana as
two-handed Çyämasundara, playing on a flute, are those of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead.

TRANSLATION
Those who study the Vedas and drink the soma juice, seeking the heavenly
planets, worship Me indirectly. They take birth on the planet of Indra, where
they enjoy godly delights.

PURPORT
The word trai-vidyäù refers to the three Vedas, Säma, Yajur and Åg. A brähmaëa
who has studied these three Vedas is called a tri-vedé. Anyone who is very much
attached to knowledge derived from these three Vedas is respected in society.
Unfortunately, there are many great scholars of the Vedas who do not know the
ultimate purport of studying them. Therefore Kåñëa herein declares Himself to be
the ultimate goal for the tri-vedés. Actual tri-vedés take shelter under the
lotus feet of Kåñëa and engage in pure devotional service to satisfy the Lord.
Devotional service begins with the chanting of the Hare Kåñëa mantra and side by
side trying to understand Kåñëa in truth. Unfortunately those who are simply
official students of the Vedas become more interested in offering sacrifices to
the different demigods like Indra, Candra, etc. By such endeavor, the worshipers
of different demigods are certainly purified of the contamination of the lower
qualities of nature and are thereby elevated to the higher planetary system or
heavenly planets known as Maharloka, Janaloka, Tapoloka, etc. Once situated on
those higher planetary systems, one can satisfy his senses hundreds of thousands
of times better than on this planet.

TRANSLATION
When they have thus enjoyed heavenly sense pleasure, they return to this mortal
planet again. Thus, through the Vedic principles, they achieve only flickering
happiness.

PURPORT
One who is promoted to those higher planetary systems enjoys a longer duration
of life and better facilities for sense enjoyment, yet one is not allowed to
stay there forever. One is again sent back to this earthly planet upon finishing
the resultant fruits of pious activities. He who has not attained perfection of
knowledge, as indicated in the Vedänta-sütra (janmädy asya yataù), or, in other
words, he who fails to understand Kåñëa, the cause of all causes, becomes
baffled in achieving the ultimate goal of life and is thus subjected to the
routine of being promoted to the higher planets and then again coming down, as
if situated on a ferris wheel which sometimes goes up and sometimes comes down.
The purport is that instead of being elevated to the spiritual world where there
is no longer any possibility of coming down, one simply revolves in the cycle of
birth and death on higher and lower planetary systems. One should better take to
the spiritual world to enjoy eternal life full of bliss and knowledge and never
return to this miserable material existence.

But those who worship Me with devotion, meditating on My transcendental form—to

PURPORT
One who is unable to live for a moment without Kåñëa consciousness cannot but
think of Kåñëa twenty-four hours, being engaged in devotional service by
hearing, chanting, remembering, offering prayers, worshiping, serving the lotus
feet of the Lord, rendering other services, cultivating friendship and
surrendering fully to the Lord. Such activities are all auspicious and full of
spiritual potencies; indeed, they make the devotee perfect in self-realization.
Then his only desire is to achieve the association of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. This is called yoga. By the mercy of the Lord, such a devotee never
comes back to this material condition of life. Kñema refers to the merciful
protection of the Lord. The Lord helps the devotee to achieve Kåñëa
consciousness by yoga, and when he becomes fully Kåñëa conscious the Lord
protects him from falling down to a miserable conditioned life.

TRANSLATION
Whatever a man may sacrifice to other gods, O son of Kunté, is really meant for
Me alone, but it is offered without true understanding.

PURPORT
“Persons who are engaged in the worship of demigods are not very intelligent,
although such worship is done to Me indirectly,” Kåñëa says. For example, when a
man pours water on the leaves and branches of a tree without pouring water on
the root, he does so without sufficient knowledge or without observing
regulative principles. Similarly, the process of rendering service to different
parts of the body is to supply food to the stomach. The demigods are, so to
speak, different officers and directors in the government of the Supreme Lord.
One has to follow the laws made by the government, not by the officers or
directors. Similarly, everyone is to offer his worship to the Supreme Lord only.
That will automatically satisfy the different officers and directors of the
Lord. The officers and directors are engaged as representatives of the
government, and to offer some bribe to the officers and directors is illegal.
This is stated here as avidhi-pürvakam. In other words, Kåñëa does not approve
the unnecessary worship of the demigods.

TRANSLATION
I am the only enjoyer and the only object of sacrifice. Those who do not

PURPORT
Here it is clearly stated that there are many types of yajïa performances
recommended in the Vedic literatures, but actually all of them are meant for
satisfying the Supreme Lord. Yajïa means Viñëu. In the Second Chapter of
Bhagavad-gétä it is clearly stated that one should only work for satisfying
Yajïa or Viñëu. The perfectional form of human civilization, known as
varëäçrama-dharma, is specifically meant for satisfying Viñëu. Therefore, Kåñëa
says in this verse, “I am the enjoyer of all sacrifices because I am the supreme
master.” However, less intelligent persons, without knowing this fact, worship
demigods for temporary benefit. Therefore they fall down to material existence
and do not achieve the desired goal of life. If, however, anyone has any
material desire to be fulfilled, he had better pray for it to the Supreme Lord
(although that is not pure devotion), and he will thus achieve the desired
result.

Those who worship the demigods will take birth among the demigods; those who

PURPORT
If anyone has any desire to go to the moon, the sun, or any other planet, one
can attain the desired destination by following specific Vedic principles
recommended for that purpose. These are vividly described in the fruitive
activities portion of the Vedas, technically known as darça-paurëamäsé, which
recommends a specific worship of demigods situated on different heavenly
planets. Similarly, one can attain the pitä planets by performing a specific
yajïa. Similarly, one can go to many ghostly planets and become a yakña, rakña
or piçäca. Piçäca worship is called “black arts” or “black magic.” There are
many men who practice this black art, and they think that it is spiritualism,
but such activities are completely materialistic. Similarly, a pure devotee, who
worships the Supreme Personality of Godhead only, achieves the planets of
Vaikuëöha and Kåñëaloka without a doubt. It is very easy to understand through
this important verse that if by simply worshiping the demigods one can achieve
the heavenly planets, or by worshiping the pitä achieve the pitä planets, or by
practicing the black arts achieve the ghostly planets, why can the pure devotee
not achieve the planet of Kåñëa or Viñëu? Unfortunately many people have no
information of these sublime planets where Kåñëa and Viñëu live, and because
they do not know of them they fall down. Even the impersonalists fall down from
the brahmajyoti. This Kåñëa consciousness movement is therefore distributing
sublime information to the entire human society to the effect that by simply
chanting the Hare Kåñëa mantra one can become perfect in this life and go back
home, back to Godhead.

TRANSLATION
If one offers Me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower, fruit a water, I will

PURPORT
Here Lord Kåñëa, having established that He is the only enjoyer, the primeval
Lord, and the real object of all sacrificial offerings, reveals what types of
sacrifices He desires to be offered. If one wishes to engage in devotional
service to the Supreme in order to be purified and to reach the goal of life—the
transcendental loving service of God—then he should find out what the Lord
desires of him. One who loves Kåñëa will give Him whatever He wants, and he
avoids offering anything which is undesirable or unasked for. Thus, meat, fish
and eggs should not be offered to Kåñëa. If He desired such things as offerings,
He would have said so. Instead He clearly requests that a leaf, fruit, flowers
and water be given to Him, and He says of this offering, “I will accept it.”
Therefore, we should understand that He will not accept meat, fish and eggs.
Vegetables, grains, fruits, milk and water are the proper foods for human beings
and are prescribed by Lord Kåñëa Himself. Whatever else we eat cannot be offered
to Him, since He will not accept it. Thus we cannot be acting on the level of
loving devotion if we offer such foods.

In the Third Chapter, verse thirteen, Çré Kåñëa explains that only the remains
of sacrifice are purified and fit for consumption by those who are seeking
advancement in life and release from the clutches of the material entanglement.
Those who do not make an offering of their food, He says in the same verse, are
said to be eating only sin. In other words, their every mouthful is simply
deepening their involvement in the complexities of material nature. But
preparing nice, simple vegetable dishes, offering them before the picture or
Deity of Lord Kåñëa and bowing down and praying for Him to accept such a humble
offering, enable one to advance steadily in life, to purify the body, and to
create fine brain tissues which will lead to clear thinking. Above all, the
offering should be made with an attitude of love. Kåñëa has no need of food,
since He already possesses everything that be, yet He will accept the offering
of one who desires to please Him in that way. The important element, in
preparation, in serving and in offering, is to act with love for Kåñëa.

The impersonalist philosophers, who wish to maintain that the Absolute Truth is
without senses, cannot comprehend this verse of Bhagavad-gétä. To them, it is
either a metaphor or proof of the mundane character of Kåñëa, the speaker of the
Gétä. But, in actuality, Kåñëa, the Supreme Godhead, has senses, and it is
stated that His senses are interchangeable; in other words, one sense can
perform the function of any other. This is what it means to say that Kåñëa is
absolute. Lacking senses, He could hardly be considered full in all opulences.
In the Seventh Chapter, Kåñëa has explained that He impregnates the living
entities into material nature. This is done by His looking upon material nature.
And so in this instance, Kåñëa’s hearing the devotee’s words of love in offering
foodstuffs is wholly identical with His eating and actually tasting. This point
should be emphasized: because of His absolute position, His hearing is wholly
identical with His eating and tasting. Only the devotee, who accepts Kåñëa as He
describes Himself, without interpretation, can understand that the Supreme
Absolute Truth can eat food and enjoy it.

O son of Kunté, all that you do, all that you eat, all that you offer and give

offering unto Me.

PURPORT
Thus, it is the duty of everyone to mold his life in such a way that he will not
forget Kåñëa in any circumstance. Everyone has to work for maintenance of his
body and soul together, and Kåñëa recommends herein that one should work for
Him. Everyone has to eat something to live; therefore he should accept the
remnants of foodstuffs offered to Kåñëa. Any civilized man has to perform some
religious ritualistic ceremonies; therefore Kåñëa recommends, “Do it for Me,”
and this is called arcanä. Everyone has a tendency to give something in charity;
Kåñëa says, “Give it to Me,” and this means that all surplus money accummulated
should be utilized in furthering the Kåñëa consciousness movement. Nowadays
people are very much inclined to the meditational process, which is not
practical in this age, but if anyone practices meditating on Kåñëa twenty-four
hours by chanting the Hare Kåñëa mantra round his beads, he is surely the
greatest yogé, as substantiated by the Sixth Chapter of Bhagavad-gétä.

PURPORT
One who acts in Kåñëa consciousness under superior direction is called yukta.
The technical term is yukta-vairägya. This is further explained by Rüpa Gosvämé
as follows.

Rüpa Gosvämé says that as long as we are in this material world we have to act;
we cannot cease acting. Therefore if actions are performed and the fruits are
given to Kåñëa, then that is called yukta-vairägya. Actually situated in
renunciation, such activities clear the mirror of the mind, and as the actor
gradually makes progress in spiritual realization he becomes completely
surrendered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore at the end he
becomes liberated, and this liberation is also specified. By this liberation he
does not become one with the brahmajyoti but rather enters into the planet of
the Supreme Lord. It is clearly mentioned here: mäm upaiñyasi, “he comes to Me,”
back home, back to Godhead. There are five different stages of liberation, and
here it is specified that the devotee who has always lived his lifetime here
under the direction of the Supreme Lord, as stated, has evolved to the point
where he can, after quitting this body, go back to Godhead and engage directly
in the association of the Supreme Lord.

Anyone who has no other interest but to dedicate his life to the service of the
Lord is actually a sannyäsé Such a person always thinks of himself as an eternal
servant, dependant on the supreme will of the Lord. As such, whatever he does,
he does it for the benefit of the Lord. Whatever action he performs, he performs
it as service to the Lord. He does not give serious attention to the fruitive
activities or prescribed duties mentioned in the Vedas. For ordinary persons it
is obligatory to execute the prescribed duties mentioned in the Vedas, but
although a pure devotee who is completely engaged in the service of the Lord may
sometimes appear to go against the prescribed Vedic duties, actually it is not
so.

It is said, therefore, by Vaiñëava authorities that even the most intelligent
person cannot understand the plans and activities of a pure devotee. The exact
words are vaiñëavera kriyä mudrä vijïe nä bujhayä. A person who is thus always
engaged in the service of the Lord or is always thinking and planning how to
serve the Lord is to be considered completely liberated at present and in the
future. His going home, back to Godhead, is guaranteed. He is above all
materialistic criticism, just as Kåñëa is above all criticism.

TRANSLATION
I envy no one, nor am I partial to anyone. I am equal to all. But whoever
renders service unto Me in devotion is a friend, is in Me, and I am also a
friend to him.

PURPORT
One may question here that if Kåñëa is equal to everyone and no one is His
special friend, then why does He take a special interest in the devotees who are
always engaged in His transcendental service? But this is not discrimination; it
is natural. Any man in this material world may be very charitably disposed, yet
he has a special interest in his own children. The Lord claims that every living
entity—in whatever form—is His son, and as such He provides everyone with a
generous supply of the necessities of life. He is just like a cloud which pours
rain all over, regardless whether it falls on rock or land or water. But for His
devotees, He gives specific attention. Such devotees are mentioned here: they
are always in Kåñëa consciousness, and therefore they are always
transcendentally situated in Kåñëa. The very phrase Kåñëa consciousness suggests
that those who are in such consciousness are living transcendentalists, situated
in Him. The Lord says here distinctly, “mayi te,” “in Me.” Naturally, as a
result, the Lord is also in them. This is reciprocal. This also explains the
words: asti na priyaù/ye bhajanti: “Whoever surrenders unto Me, proportionately
I take care of him.” This transcendental reciprocation exists because both the
Lord and the devotee are conscious. When a diamond is set in a golden ring, it
looks very nice. The gold is glorified, and at the same time the diamond is
glorified. The Lord and the living entity eternally glitter, and when a living
entity becomes inclined to the service of the Supreme Lord, he looks like gold.
The Lord is a diamond, and so this combination is very nice. Living entities in
a pure state are called devotees. The Supreme Lord becomes the devotee of His
devotees. If a reciprocal relationship is not present between the devotee and
the Lord, then there is no personalist philosophy. In the impersonal philosophy
there is no reciprocation between the Supreme and the living entity, but in the
personalist philosophy there is.

The example is often given that the Lord is like a desire tree, and whatever one
wants from this desire tree, the Lord supplies. But here the explanation is more
complete. The Lord is here stated to be partial to the devotees. This is the
manifestation of the Lord’s special mercy to the devotees. The Lord’s
reciprocation should not be considered to be under the law of karma. It belongs
to the transcendental situation in which the Lord and His devotees function.
Devotional service of the Lord is not an activity of this material world; it is
part of the spiritual world where eternity, bliss and knowledge predominate.

deviation; sädhuù—saint; eva—certainly; saù—he; mantavyaù—to be considered;

TRANSLATION
Even if one commits the most abominable actions, if he is engaged in devotional
service, he is to be considered saintly because he is properly situated.

PURPORT
The word suduräcäro used in this verse is very significant, and we should
understand it properly. When a living entity is conditioned, he has two kinds of
activities: one is conditional, and the other is constitutional. As for
protecting the body or abiding by the rules of society and state, certainly
there are different activities, even for the devotees, in connection with the
conditional life, and such activities are called conditional. Besides these, the
living entity who is fully conscious of his spiritual nature and is engaged in
Kåñëa consciousness, or the devotional service of the Lord, has activities which
are called transcendental. Such activities are performed in his constitutional
position, and they are technically called devotional service. Now, in the
conditioned state, sometimes devotional service and the conditional service in
relation to the body will parallel one another. But then again, sometimes these
activities become opposed to one another. As far as possible, a devotee is very
cautious so that he does not do anything that could disrupt his wholesome
condition. He knows that perfection in his activities depends on his progressive
realization of Kåñëa consciousness. Sometimes, however, it may be seen that a
person in Kåñëa consciousness commits some act which may be taken as most
abominable socially or politically. But such a temporary falldown does not
disqualify him. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam it is stated that if a person falls
down, but is wholeheartedly engaged in the transcendental service of the Supreme
Lord, the Lord, being situated within his heart, beautifies him and excuses him
from that abomination. The material contamination is so strong that even a yogé
fully engaged in the service of the Lord sometimes becomes ensnared; but Kåñëa
consciousness is so strong that such an occasional falldown is at once
rectified. Therefore the process of devotional service is always a success. No
one should deride a devotee for some accidental falldown from the ideal path,
for, as is explained in the next verse, such occasional falldowns will be
stopped in due course, as soon as a devotee is completely situated in Kåñëa
consciousness.

Therefore a person who is situated in Kåñëa consciousness and is engaged with
determination in the process of chanting Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa,
Hare Hare/Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare should be considered to be
in the transcendental position, even if by chance or accident he is found to
have fallen. The words sädhur eva, “he is saintly,” are very emphatic. They are
a warning to the nondevotees that because of an accidental falldown a devotee
should not be derided; he should still be considered saintly even if he has
fallen down accidentally. And the word mantavyaù is still more emphatic. If one
does not follow this rule, and derides a devotee for his accidental falldown,
then he is disobeying the order of the Supreme Lord. The only qualification of a
devotee is to be unflinchingly and exclusively engaged in devotional service.

The mark of a spot which may be seen on the moon does not become an impediment
to the moonlight. Similarly, the accidental falldown of a devotee from the path
of a saintly character does not make him abominable. On the other hand, one
should not misunderstand that a devotee in transcendental devotional service can
act in all kinds of abominable ways; this verse only refers to an accident due
to the strong power of material connections. Devotional service is more or less
a declaration of war against the illusory energy. As long as one is not strong
enough to fight the illusory energy, there may be accidental falldowns. But when
one is strong enough, he is no longer subjected to such falldowns, as previously
explained. No one should take advantage of this verse and commit nonsense and
think that he is still a devotee. If he does not improve in his character by
devotional service, then it is to be understood that he is not a high devotee.

na—never; me—Mine; bhaktaù—devotee; praëaçyati—perishes.

TRANSLATION
He quickly becomes righteous and attains lasting peace. O son of Kunté, declare
it boldly that My devotee never perishes.

PURPORT
This should not be misunderstood. In the Seventh Chapter the Lord says that one
who is engaged in mischievous activities cannot become a devotee of the Lord.
One who is not a devotee of the Lord has no good qualifications whatsoever. The
question remains, then, how can a person engaged in abominable activities—either
by accident or intention—be a pure devotee? This question may justly be raised.
The miscreants, as stated in the Seventh Chapter, who never come to the
devotional service of the Lord, have no good qualifications, as is stated in the
Çrémad-Bhägavatam. Generally, a devotee who is engaged in the nine kinds of
devotional activities is engaged in the process of cleansing all material
contamination from the heart. He puts the Supreme Personality of Godhead within
his heart, and all sinful contaminations are naturally washed away. Continuous
thinking of the Supreme Lord makes him pure by nature. According to the Vedas,
there is a certain regulation that if one falls down from his exalted position,
he has to undergo certain ritualistic processes to purify himself. But here
there is no such condition because the purifying process is already there in the
heart of the devotee, due to his remembering the Supreme Personality of Godhead
constantly. Therefore, the chanting of Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare
Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare should be continued without
stoppage. This will protect a devotee from all accidental falldowns. He will
thus remain perpetually free from all material contaminations.

TRANSLATION
O son of Påthä, those who take shelter in Me, though they be of lower
birth—women, vaiçyas [merchants], as well as çüdras [workers]—can approach the
supreme destination.

PURPORT
It is clearly declared here by the Supreme Lord that in devotional service there
is no distinction between the lower or higher classes of people. In the material
conception of life, there are such divisions, but for a person engaged in
transcendental devotional service to the Lord, there are not. Everyone is
eligible for the supreme destination. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam it is stated that
even the lowest, who are called caëòälas (dog-eaters), can be elevated by
association with a pure devotee. Therefore devotional service and guidance of a
pure devotee are so strong that there is no discrimination between the lower and
higher classes of men; anyone can take to it. The most simple man taking center
of the pure devotee can be purified by proper guidance. According to the
different modes of material nature, men are classified in the mode of goodness
(brähmaëas), the mode of passion (kñatriyas, or administrators), the mixed modes
of passion and ignorance (vaiçyas, or merchants), and the mode of ignorance
(çüdras, or workers). Those lower than them are called caëòälas, and they are
born in sinful families. Generally, those who are born in sinful families are
not accepted by the higher classes. But the process of devotional service and
the pure devotee of the Supreme God are so strong that all the lower classes can
attain the highest perfection of life. This is possible only when one takes
center of Kåñëa. One has to take center completely of Kåñëa. Then one can become
much greater than great jïänés and yogés.

TRANSLATION
How much greater then are the brähmaëas, the righteous, the devotees and saintly
kings who in this temporary miserable world engage in loving service unto Me.

PURPORT
In this material world there are classifications of people, but, after all, this
world is not a happy place for anyone. It is clearly stated here, anityam
asukhaà lokam: this world is temporary and full of miseries, not habitable for
any sane gentleman. This world is declared by the Supreme Personality of Godhead
to be temporary and full of miseries. Some of the philosophers, especially the
minor philosophers, say that this world is false, but we can understand from
Bhagavad-gétä that the world is not false; it is temporary. There is a
difference between temporary and false. This world is temporary, but there is
another world which is eternal. This world is miserable, but the other world is
eternal and blissful.

Arjuna was born in a saintly royal family. To him also the Lord says, “Take to
My devotional service and come quickly back to Godhead, back home.” No one
should remain in this temporary world, full as it is with miseries. Everyone
should attach himself to the bosom of the Supreme Personality of Godhead so that
he can be eternally happy. The devotional service of the Supreme Lord is the
only process by which all problems of all classes of men can be solved. Everyone
should therefore take to Kåñëa consciousness and make his life perfect.

PURPORT
In this verse it is clearly indicated that Kåñëa consciousness is the only means
of being delivered from the clutches of this contaminated material world.
Sometimes unscrupulous commentators distort the meaning of what is clearly
stated here: that all devotional service should be offered to the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa. Unfortunately, unscrupulous commentators divert
the mind of the reader to that which is not at all feasible. Such commentators
do not know that there is no difference between Kåñëa’s mind and Kåñëa. Kåñëa is
not an ordinary human being; He is Absolute Truth. His body, mind and He Himself
are one and absolute. It is stated in the Kürma Puräëa, as it is quoted by
Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Gosvämé in his Anubhäñya comments on
Caitanya-caritämrta, Fifth Chapter, Ädi-lélä, verses 41–48, “deha-dehi-vibhedo
’yaà neçvare vidyate kvacit,” which means that there is no difference in Kåñëa,
the Supreme Lord, between Himself and His body. But, because they do not know
this science of Kåñëa, the commentators hide Kåñëa and divide His personality
from His mind or from His body. Although this is sheer ignorance of the science
of Kåñëa, some men make profit out of misleading the people.

There are some who are demonic; they also think of Kåñëa, but enviously, just
like King Kaàsa, Kåñëa’s uncle. He was also thinking of Kåñëa always, but he
thought of Kåñëa as his enemy. He was always in anxiety, wondering when Kåñëa
would come to kill him. That kind of thinking will not help us. One should be
thinking of Kåñëa in devotional love. That is bhakti. One should cultivate the
knowledge of Kåñëa continually. What is that favorable cultivation? It is to
learn from a bona fide teacher. Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and
we have several times explained that His body is not material, but is eternal,
blissful knowledge. This kind of talk about Kåñëa will help one become a
devotee. Otherwise, understanding Kåñëa from the wrong source will prove
fruitless.

One should therefore engage his mind in the eternal form, the primal form of
Kåñëa; with conviction in his heart that Kåñëa is the Supreme, he should engage
himself in worship. There are hundreds of thousands of temples in India for the
worship of Kåñëa, and devotional service is practiced there. When such practice
is made, one has to offer obeisances to Kåñëa. One should lower his head before
the Deity and engage his mind, his body, his activities—everything. That will
make one fully absorbed in Kåñëa without deviation. This will help one transfer
into the Kåñëaloka. One should not be deviated by unscrupulous commentators. One
must engage in the nine different processes of devotional service, beginning
with hearing and chanting about Kåñëa. Pure devotional service is the highest
achievement of human society.

In the Seventh and Eighth Chapters of Bhagavad-gétä, pure devotional service to
the Lord has been explained, apart from the yoga of knowledge and mystic yoga or
fruitive activities. Those who are not purely sanctified may be attracted by
different features of the Lord, like the impersonal brahmajyoti and localized
Paramätmä, but a pure devotee directly takes to the service of the Supreme Lord.

There is a beautiful poem about Kåñëa in which it is clearly stated that any
person who is engaged in the worship of demigods is most unintelligent and
cannot achieve at any time the supreme award of Kåñëa. The devotee, in the
beginning, may sometimes fall from the standard, but still he should be
considered superior to all other philosophers and yogés. One who always engages
in Kåñëa consciousness should be understood to be the perfect saintly person.
His accidental nondevotional activities will diminish, and he will soon be
situated without any doubt in complete perfection. The pure devotee has no
actual chance to fall down because the Supreme Godhead personally takes care of
His pure devotees. Therefore, the intelligent person should take directly to
this process of Kåñëa consciousness and happily live in this material world. He
will eventually receive the supreme award of Kåñëa.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Ninth Chapter of the
Çrémad-Bhagavad-gétä in the matter of the Most Confidential Knowledge.



CHAPTER TEN

The Opulence of the Absolute

TRANSLATION
The Supreme Lord said: My dear friend, mighty-armed Arjuna, listen again to My
supreme word, which I shall impart to you for your benefit and which will give
you great joy.

PURPORT
The word paramam is explained thus by Paräçara Muni: one who is full in six
opulences, who has full strength, full fame, wealth, knowledge, beauty and
renunciation, is paramam, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. While Kåñëa was
present on this earth, He displayed all six opulences. Therefore great sages
like Paräçara Muni have all accepted Kåñëa as the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. Now Kåñëa is instructing Arjuna in more confidential knowledge of His
opulences and His work. Previously, beginning with the Seventh Chapter, the Lord
already explained His different energies and how they are acting. Now in this
chapter He explains His specific opulences to Arjuna. In the previous chapter he
has clearly explained His different energies to establish devotion in firm
conviction. Again in this chapter He tells Arjuna about His manifestations and
various opulences.

The more one hears about the Supreme God, the more one becomes fixed in
devotional service. One should always hear about the Lord in the association of
devotees; that will enhance one’s devotional service. Discourses in the society
of devotees can take place only among those who are really anxious to be in
Kåñëa consciousness. Others cannot take part in such discourses. The Lord
clearly tells Arjuna that because he is very dear to Him, for his benefit such
discourses are taking place.

TRANSLATION
Neither the hosts of demigods nor the great sages know My origin, for, in every
respect, I am the source of the demigods and the sages.

PURPORT
As stated in the Brahma-saàhitä, Lord Kåñëa is the Supreme Lord. No one is
greater than Him; He is the cause of all causes. Here it is also stated by the
Lord personally that He is the cause of all the demigods and sages. Even the
demigods and great sages cannot understand Kåñëa; they can understand neither
His name nor His personality, so what is the position of the so-called scholars
of this tiny planet? No one can understand why this Supreme God comes to earth
as an ordinary human being and executes such commonplace and yet wonderful
activities. One should know, then, that scholarship is not the qualification
necessary to understand Kåñëa. Even the demigods and the great sages have tried
to understand Kåñëa by their mental speculation, and they have failed to do so.
In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam also it is clearly said that even the great demigods
are not able to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They can
speculate to the limits of their imperfect senses and can reach the opposite
conclusion of impersonalism, of something not manifested by the three qualities
of material nature, or they can imagine something by mental speculation, but it
is not possible to understand Kåñëa by such foolish speculation.

Here the Lord indirectly says that if anyone wants to know the Absolute Truth,
“Here I am present as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. I am the Supreme.” One
should know this. Although one cannot understand the inconceivable Lord who is
personally present, He nonetheless exists. We can actually understand Kåñëa, who
is eternal, full of bliss and knowledge, simply by studying His words in
Bhagavad-gétä and Çrémad-Bhägavatam. The impersonal Brahman can be conceived by
persons who are already in the inferior energy of the Lord, but the Personality
of Godhead cannot be conceived unless one is in the transcendental position.

Because most men cannot understand Kåñëa in His actual situation, out of His
causeless mercy He descends to show favor to such speculators. Yet despite the
Supreme Lord’s uncommon activities, these speculators, due to contamination in
the material energy, still think that the impersonal Brahman is the Supreme.
Only the devotees who are fully surrendered unto the Supreme Lord can
understand, by the grace of the Supreme Personality, that He is Kåñëa. The
devotees of the Lord do not bother about the impersonal Brahman conception of
God; their faith and devotion bring them to surrender immediately unto the
Supreme Lord, and out of the causeless mercy of Kåñëa, they can understand
Kåñëa. No one else can understand Him. So even great sages agree: What is ätmä,
what is the Supreme? It is He whom we have to worship.

TRANSLATION
He who knows Me as the unborn, as the beginningless, as the Supreme Lord of all
the worlds—he, undeluded among men, is freed from all sins.

PURPORT
As stated in the Seventh Chapter, those who are trying to elevate themselves to
the platform of spiritual realization are not ordinary men. They are superior to
millions and millions of ordinary men who have no knowledge of spiritual
realization, but out of those actually trying to understand their spiritual
situation, one who can come to the understanding that Kåñëa is the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, the proprietor of everything, the unborn, is the most
successful spiritually realized person. In that stage only, when one has fully
understood Kåñëa’s supreme position, can one be free completely from all sinful
reactions.

Here the word ajam, meaning unborn, should not be confused with the living
entities, who are described in the Second Chapter as ajam. The Lord is different
from the living entities who are taking birth and dying due to material
attachment. The conditional souls are changing their bodies, but His body is not
changeable. Even when He comes to this material world, He comes as the same
unborn; therefore in the Fourth Chapter it is said that the Lord, by His
internal potency, is not under the inferior material energy, but is always in
the superior energy.

He was existing before the creation, and He is different from His creation. All
the demigods were created within this material world, but as far as Kåñëa is
concerned, it is said that He is not created; therefore Kåñëa is different even
from the great demigods like Brahmä and Çiva. And because He is the creator of
Brahmä, Çiva and all the other demigods, He is the Supreme Person of all
planets.

Çré Kåñëa is therefore different from everything that is created, and anyone who
knows Him as such immediately becomes liberated from all sinful reaction. One
must be liberated from all sinful activities to be in the knowledge of the
Supreme Lord. Only by devotional service can He be known and not by any other
means, as stated in Bhagavad-gétä.

One should not try to understand Kåñëa as a human being. As stated previously,
only a foolish person thinks Him to be a human being. This is again expressed
here in a different way. A man who is not foolish, who is intelligent enough to
understand the constitutional position of the Godhead, is always free from all
sinful reactions.

If Kåñëa is known as the son of Devaké, then how can He be unborn? That is also
explained in Çrémad-Bhägavatam: When He appeared before Devaké and Vasudeva, He
was not born as an ordinary child; He appeared in His original form, and then He
transformed Himself into an ordinary child.

Anything done under the direction of Kåñëa is transcendental. It cannot be
contaminated by the material reactions, which may be auspicious or inauspicious.
The conception that there are things auspicious and inauspicious in the material
world is more or less a mental concoction because there is nothing auspicious in
the material world. Everything is inauspicious because the very material mask is
inauspicious. We simply imagine it to be auspicious. Real auspiciousness depends
on activities in Kåñëa consciousness in full devotion and service. Therefore if
we at all want our activities to he auspicious, then we should work under the
directions of the Supreme Lord. Such directions are given in authoritative
scriptures such as Çrémad-Bhägavatam and Bhagavad-gétä, or from a bona fide
spiritual master. Because the spiritual master is the representative of the
Supreme Lord, his direction is directly the direction of the Supreme Lord. The
spiritual master, saintly persons and scriptures direct in the same way. There
is no contradiction in these three sources. All actions done under such
direction are free from the reactions of pious or impious activities of this
material world. The transcendental attitude of the devotee in the performance of
activities is actually that of renunciation, and this is called sannyäsa. Anyone
acting under the direction of the Supreme Lord is actually a sannyäsé and a
yogé, and not the man who has simply taken the dress of the sannyäsé, or a
pseudo-yogé.

TRANSLATION
Intelligence, knowledge, freedom from doubt and delusion, forgiveness,
truthfulness, self-control and calmness, pleasure and pain, birth, death, fear,
fearlessness, nonviolence, equanimity, satisfaction, austerity, charity, fame
and infamy are created by Me alone.

PURPORT
The different qualities of living entities, be they good or bad, are all created
by Kåñëa, and they are described here.

Intelligence refers to the power of analyzing things in proper perspective, and
knowledge refers to understanding what is spirit and what is matter. Ordinary
knowledge obtained by a university education pertains only to matter, and it is
not accepted here as knowledge. Knowledge means knowing the distinction between
spirit and matter. In modern education there is no knowledge about the spirit;
they are simply taking care of the material elements and bodily needs. Therefore
academic knowledge is not complete.

Asaàmohaù, freedom from doubt and delusion, can be achieved when one is not
hesitant and when he understands the transcendental philosophy. Slowly but
surely he becomes free from bewilderment. Nothing should be accepted blindly;
everything should be accepted with care and with caution. Kñamä, forgiveness,
should be practiced, and one should excuse the minor offenses of others. Satyam,
truthfulness, means that facts should be presented as they are for the benefit
of others. Facts should not be misrepresented. According to social conventions,
it is said that one can speak the truth only when it is palatable to others. But
that is not truthfulness. The truth should be spoken in a straight and forward
way, so that others will understand actually what the facts are. If a man is a
thief and if people are warned that he is a thief, that is truth. Although
sometimes the truth is unpalatable, one should not refrain from speaking it.
Truthfulness demands that the facts be presented as they are for the benefit of
others. That is the definition of truth.

Self-control means that the senses should not be used for unnecessary personal
enjoyment. There is no prohibition against meeting the proper needs of the
senses, but unnecessary sense enjoyment is detrimental for spiritual
advancement. Therefore the senses should be restrained from unnecessary use.
Similarly, the mind should not indulge in unnecessary thoughts; that is called
çamaù, or calmness. Nor should one spend one’s time pondering over earning
money. That is a misuse of the thinking power. The mind should be used to
understand the prime necessity of human beings, and that should be presented
authoritatively. The power of thought should be developed in association with
persons who are authorities in the scriptures, saintly persons and spiritual
masters and those whose thinking is highly developed. Sukham, pleasure or
happiness, should always be in that which is favorable for the cultivation of
the spiritual knowledge of Kåñëa consciousness. And similarly, that which is
painful or which causes distress is that which is unfavorable for the
cultivation of Kåñëa consciousness. Anything favorable for the development of
Kåñëa consciousness should be accepted, and anything unfavorable should be
rejected.

Bhava, birth, should be understood to refer to the body. As far as the soul is
concerned, there is neither birth nor death; that we have discussed in the
beginning of Bhagavad-gétä. Birth and death apply to one’s embodiment in the
material world. Fear is due to worrying about the future. A person in Kåñëa
consciousness has no fear because by his activities he is sure to go back to the
spiritual sky, back home, back to Godhead. Therefore his future is very bright.
Others, however, do not know what their future holds; they have no knowledge of
what the next life holds. So they are therefore in constant anxiety. If we want
to get free from anxiety, then the best course is to understand Kåñëa and be
situated always in Kåñëa consciousness. In that way we will be free from all
fear. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam. it is stated that fear is caused by our
absorption in the illusory energy, but those who are free from the illusory
energy, those who are confident that they are not the material body, that they
are spiritual parts of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and are therefore
engaged in the transcendental service of the Supreme Godhead, have nothing to
fear. Their future is very bright. This fear is a condition of persons who are
not in Kåñëa consciousness. Bhayam, fearlessness, is only possible for one in
Kåñëa consciousness.

Ahiàsä, nonviolence, means that one should not do anything which will put others
into misery or confusion. Material activities that are promised by so many
politicians, sociologists, philanthropists, etc., do not produce very good
results because the politicians and philanthropists have no transcendental
vision; they do not know what is actually beneficial for human society. Ahiàsä
means that people should be trained in such a way that the full utilization of
the human body can be achieved. The human body is meant for spiritual
realization, so any movement or any commissions which do not further that end
commit violence on the human body. That which furthers the future spiritual
happiness of the people in general is called nonviolence.

Samatä, equanimity, refers to freedom from attachment and aversion. To be very
much attached or to be very much detached is not the best. This material world
should be accepted without attachment or aversion. Similarly, that which is
favorable for prosecuting Kåñëa consciousness should be accepted; that which is
unfavorable should be rejected. That is called samatä, equanimity. A person in
Kåñëa consciousness has nothing to reject and nothing to accept unless it is
useful in the prosecution of Kåñëa consciousness.

Tuñöiù, satisfaction, means that one should not be eager to gather more and more
material goods by unnecessary activity. One should be satisfied with whatever is
obtained by the grace of the Supreme Lord; that is called satisfaction. Tapas
means austerity or penance. There are many rules and definitions in the Vedas
which apply here, like rising early in the morning and taking a bath. Sometimes
it is very troublesome to rise early in the morning, but whatever voluntary
trouble one may suffer in this way is called penance. Similarly, there are
prescriptions for fasting on certain days of the month. One may not be inclined
to practice such fasting, but because of his determination to make advancement
in the science of Kåñëa consciousness, he should accept such bodily troubles
which are recommended. However, one should not fast unnecessarily or against
Vedic injunctions. One should not fast for some political purpose; that is
described in Bhagavad-gétä as fasting in ignorance, and anything done in
ignorance or passion does not lead to spiritual advancement. Everything done in
the mode of goodness does advance one, however, and fasting done in terms of the
Vedic injunctions enriches one in spiritual knowledge.

As far as charity is concerned, one should give fifty percent of his earnings to
some good cause. And what is a good cause? It is that which is conducted in
terms of Kåñëa consciousness. That is not only a good cause, but it is the best
cause. Because Kåñëa is good, His cause is also good. Thus charity should be
given to a person who is engaged in Kåñëa consciousness. According to Vedic
literature, it is enjoined that charity should be given to the brähmaëas. This
practice is still followed, although not very nicely in terms of the Vedic
injunction. But still the injunction is that charity should be given to the
brähmaëas. Why? Because they are engaged in higher cultivation of spiritual
knowledge. A brähmaëa is supposed to devote his whole life to understanding
Brahman. A brahma-jana is one who knows Brahman; he is called a brähmaëa. Thus
charity is offered to the brähmaëas because since they are always engaged in
higher spiritual service, they have no time to earn their livelihood. In the
Vedic literature, charity is also to be awarded to the renouncer of life, the
sannyäsé. The sannyäsés beg from door to door, not for money but for missionary
purposes. The system is that they go from door to door to awaken the
householders from the slumber of ignorance. Because the householders are engaged
in family affairs and have forgotten their actual purpose in life—awakening
their Kåñëa consciousness—it is the business of the sannyäsés to go as beggars
to the householders and encourage them to be Kåñëa conscious. As it is said in
the Vedas, one should awake and achieve what is due him in this human form of
life. This knowledge and method is distributed by the sannyäsés; hence charity
is to be given to the renouncer of life, to the brähmaëas, and similar good
causes, not to any whimsical cause.

Yaçaù, fame, should be according to Lord Caitanya, who said that a man is famous
when he is known as a great devotee. That is real fame. If one has become a
great man in Kåñëa consciousness and it is known, then he is truly famous. One
who does not have such fame is infamous.

All these qualities are manifest throughout the universe in human society and in
the society of the demigods. There are many forms of humanity on other planets,
and these qualities are there. Now, for one who wants to advance in Kåñëa
consciousness, Kåñëa creates all these qualities, but the person develops them
himself from within. One who engages in the devotional service of the Supreme
Lord develops all the good qualities, as arranged by the Supreme Lord.

Of whatever we find, good or bad, the origin is Kåñëa. Nothing can manifest in
this material world which is not in Kåñëa. That is knowledge; although we know
that things are differently situated, we should realize that everything flows
from Kåñëa.

TRANSLATION
The seven great sages and before them the four other great sages and the Manus
[progenitors of mankind] are born out of My mind, and all creatures in these
planets descend from them.

PURPORT
The Lord is giving a genealogical synopsis of the universal population. Brahmä
is the original creature born out of the energy of the Supreme Lord known as
Hiraëyagarbha. And from Brahmä all the seven great sages, and before them four
other great sages, named Sanaka, Sananda, Sanätana, and Sanatkumära, and the
Manus, are manifest. All these twenty-five great sages are known as the
patriarchs of the living entities all over the universe. There are innumerable
universes and innumerable planets within each universe, and each planet is full
of population of different varieties. All of them are born of these twenty-five
patriarchs. Brahmä underwent penance for one thousand years of the demigods
before he realized by the grace of Kåñëa how to create. Then from Brahmä,
Sanaka, Sananda, Sanätana, and Sanatkumära came out, then Rudra, and then the
seven sages, and in this way all the brähmaëas and kñatriyas are born out of the
energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Brahmä is known as pitämaha, the
grandfather, and Kåñëa is known as the prapitä-maha, the father of the
grandfather. That is stated in the Eleventh Chapter of the Bhagavad-gétä. (Bg.
11.39)

TRANSLATION
He who knows in truth this glory and power of Mine engages in unalloyed
devotional service; of this there is no doubt.

PURPORT
The highest summit of spiritual perfection is knowledge of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. Unless one is firmly convinced of the different
opulences of the Supreme Lord, he cannot engage in devotional service. Generally
people know that God is great, but they do not know in detail how God is great.
Here are the details. If one knows factually how God is great, then naturally he
becomes a surrendered soul and engages himself in the devotional service of the
Lord. When one factually knows the opulences of the Supreme, there is no
alternative but to surrender to Him. This factual knowledge can be known from
the descriptions in Çrémad-Bhägavatam and Bhagavad-gétä and similar literatures.

In the administration of this universe there are many demigods distributed
throughout the planetary system, and the chief of them are Brahmä, Lord Çiva and
the four great Kumäras and other patriarchs. There are many forefathers of the
population of the universe, and all of them are born of the Supreme Lord Kåñëa.
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, is the original forefather of all
forefathers.

These are some of the opulences of the Supreme Lord. When one is firmly
convinced of them, he accepts Kåñëa with great faith and without any doubt, and
he engages in devotional service. All this particular knowledge is required in
order to increase one’s interest in the loving devotional service of the Lord.
One should not neglect to understand fully how great Kåñëa is, for by knowing
the greatness of Kåñëa one will be able to be fixed in sincere devotional
service.

TRANSLATION
I am the source of all spiritual and material worlds. Everything emanates from
Me. The wise who know this perfectly engage in My devotional service and worship
Me with all their hearts.

PURPORT
A learned scholar who has studied the Vedas perfectly and has information from
authorities like Lord Caitanya and who knows how to apply these teachings can
understand that Kåñëa is the origin of everything in both the material and
spiritual worlds, and because he knows this perfectly he becomes firmly fixed in
the devotional service of the Supreme Lord. He can never be deviated by any
amount of nonsensical commentaries or by fools. All Vedic literature agrees that
Kåñëa is the source of Brahmä, Çiva and all other demigods. In the Atharva-veda
it is said, “yo brahmäëaà vidadhäti: pürvaà yo vai vedäàç ca gäpayati sma
kåñëaù.” “It was Kåñëa who in the beginning instructed Brahmä in Vedic knowledge
and who disseminated Vedic knowledge in the past.” Then again it is said, “atha
puruño ha vai näräyaëo ’kämayata prajäù såjeya ity upakramya.” “Then the Supreme
Personality Näräyaëa desired to create living entities.” Again it is said:

näräyaëäd brahmä jäyate, näräyaëäd prajäpatiù prajäyate, näräyaëäd indro jäyate,
näräyaëäd añöau vasavo jäyante, näräyaëäd ekädaça rudrä jäyante, näräyaëäd
dvädaçädityäù.

“From Näräyaëa, Brahmä is born, and from Näräyaëa, the patriarchs are also born.
From Näräyaëa, Indra is born, from Näräyaëa the eight Vasus are born, from
Näräyaëa the eleven Rudras are born, from Näräyaëa the twelve Ädityas are born.”

It is said in the same Vedas: brahmaëyo devaké-putraù: “The son of Devaké,
Kåñëa, is the Supreme Personality.” Then it is said:

eko vai näräyaëa äsén na brahmä na éçäno näpo nägni samau neme
dyäv-äpåthivé na nakñaträëi na süryaù sa ekäké na ramate tasya
dhyänäntaù sthasya yatra chändogaiù kriyamäëäñöakädi-saàjïakä
stuti-stomaù stomam ucyate.

“In the beginning of the creation there was only the Supreme Personality
Näräyaëa. There was no Brahmä, no Çiva, no fire, no moon, no stars in the sky,
no sun. There was only Kåñëa, who creates all and enjoys all.”

In the many Puräëas it is said that Lord Çiva was born from the highest, the
Supreme Lord Kåñëa, and the Vedas say that it is the Supreme Lord, the creator
of Brahmä and Çiva, who is to be worshiped. In the Mokña-dharma Kåñëa also says,
prajäpatià ca rudraà cäpy aham eva såjämi vai tau hi mäà na vijänéto mama
mäyä-vimohitau. “The patriarchs, Çiva and others are created by Me, though they
do not know that they are created by Me because they are deluded by My illusory
energy.” In Varäha Puräëa it is also said, näräyaëaù paro devas tasmäj jätaç
caturmukhaù tasmäd rudro ’bhavad devaù sa ca sarvajïatäà gataù. “Näräyaëa is the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, and from Him Brahmä was born, from whom Çiva was
born.”

Lord Kåñëa is the source of all generations, and He is called the most efficient
cause of everything. He says that because “everything is born of Me, I am the
original source of all. Everything is under Me; no one is above Me.” There is no
supreme controller other than Kåñëa. One who understands Kåñëa in such a way
from a bona fide spiritual master and from Vedic literature, who engages all his
energy in Kåñëa consciousness, becomes a truly learned man. In comparison to
him, all others, who do not know Kåñëa properly, are but fools. Only a fool
would consider Kåñëa to be an ordinary man. A Kåñëa conscious person should not
be bewildered by fools; he should avoid all unauthorized commentaries and
interpretations on Bhagavad-gétä and proceed in Kåñëa consciousness with
determination and firmness.

TRANSLATION
The thoughts of My pure devotees dwell in Me, their lives are surrendered to Me,
and they derive great satisfaction and bliss enlightening one another and
conversing about Me.

PURPORT
Pure devotees, whose characteristics are mentioned here, engage themselves fully
in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. Their minds cannot be diverted
from the lotus feet of Kåñëa. Their talks are solely on the transcendental
subjects. The symptoms of the pure devotees are described in this verse
specifically. Devotees of the Supreme Lord are twenty-four hours daily engaged
in glorifying the pastimes of the Supreme Lord. Their hearts and souls are
constantly submerged in Kåñëa, and they take pleasure in discussing Him with
other devotees.

In the preliminary stage of devotional service they relish the transcendental
pleasure from the service itself, and in the mature stage they are actually
situated in love of God. Once situated in that transcendental position, they can
relish the highest perfection which is exhibited by the Lord in His abode. Lord
Caitanya likens transcendental devotional service to the sowing of a seed in the
heart of the living entity. There are innumerable living entities traveling
throughout the different planets of the universe, and out of them there are a
few who are fortunate enough to meet a pure devotee and get the chance to
understand devotional service. This devotional service is just like a seed, and
if it is sown in the heart of a living entity, and if he goes on hearing and
chanting, Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma,
Räma Räma, Hare Hare, that seed fructifies, just as the seed of a tree
fructifies with regular watering. The spiritual plant of devotional service
gradually grows and grows until it penetrates the covering of the material
universe and enters into the brahmajyoti effulgence in the spiritual sky. In the
spiritual sky also that plant grows more and more until it reaches the highest
planet, which is called Goloka Våndävana, the supreme planet of Kåñëa.
Ultimately, the plant takes shelter under the lotus feet of Kåñëa and rests
there. Gradually, as a plant grows fruits and flowers, that plant of devotional
service also produces fruits, and the watering process in the form of chanting
and hearing goes on. This plant of devotional service is fully described in the
Caitanya-caritämåta. It is explained there that when the complete plant takes
shelter under the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, one becomes fully absorbed in
love of God; then he cannot live even for a moment without being in contact with
the Supreme Lord, just as a fish cannot live without water. In such a state, the
devotee actually attains the transcendental qualities in contact with the
Supreme Lord.

The Çrémad-Bhägavatam is also full of such narration about the relationship
between the Supreme Lord and His devotees; therefore the Çrémad-Bhägavatam is
very dear to the devotees. In this narration there is nothing about material
activities, sense gratification or liberation. Çrémad-Bhägavatam is the only
narration in which the transcendental nature of the Supreme Lord and His
devotees is fully described. Thus the realized souls in Kåñëa consciousness take
continual pleasure in hearing such transcendental literatures, just as a young
boy and girl take pleasure in association.

PURPORT
In this verse the word buddhi-yogam is very significant. We may remember that in
the Second Chapter the Lord, instructing Arjuna, said that He had spoken to him
of many things and that He would instruct him in the way of buddhi-yoga. Now
buddhi-yoga is explained. Buddhi-yogam itself is action in Kåñëa consciousness;
that is the highest intelligence. Buddhi means intelligence, and yogam means
mystic activities or mystic elevation. When one tries to go back home, back to
Godhead, and takes fully to Kåñëa consciousness in devotional service, his
action is called buddhi-yogam. In other words, buddhi-yogam is the process by
which one gets out of the entanglement of this material world. The ultimate goal
of progress is Kåñëa. People do not know this; therefore the association of
devotees and a bona fide spiritual master are important. One should know that
the goal is Kåñëa, and when the goal is assigned, then the path is slowly but
progressively traversed, and the ultimate goal is achieved.

When a person knows the goal of life but is addicted to the fruits of
activities, he is acting in karma-yoga. When he knows that the goal is Kåñëa,
but he takes pleasure in mental speculations to understand Kåñëa, he is acting
in jïäna-yoga. And when he knows the goal and seeks Kåñëa completely in Kåñëa
consciousness and devotional service, he is acting in bhakti-yoga, or
buddhi-yoga, which is the complete yoga. This complete yoga is the highest
perfectional stage of life.

A person may have a bona fide spiritual master and may be attached to a
spiritual organization, but still, if he is not intelligent enough to make
progress, then Kåñëa from within gives him instructions so that he may
ultimately come to Him without difficulty. The qualification is that a person
always engage himself in Kåñëa consciousness and with love and devotion render
all kinds of services. He should perform some sort of work for Kåñëa, and that
work should be with love. If a devotee is intelligent enough, he will make
progress on the path of self-realization. If one is sincere and devoted to the
activities of devotional service, the Lord gives him a chance to make progress
and ultimately attain to Him.

PURPORT
When Lord Caitanya was in Benares promulgating the chanting of Hare Kåñëa, Hare
Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare,
thousands of people were following Him. Prakäçänanda, a very influential and
learned scholar in Benares at that time, derided Lord Caitanya for being a
sentimentalist. Sometimes philosophers criticize the devotees because they think
that most of the devotees are in the darkness of ignorance and are
philosophically naive sentimentalists. Actually that is not the fact. There are
very, very learned scholars who have put forward the philosophy of devotion, but
even if a devotee does not take advantage of their literatures or of his
spiritual master, if he is sincere in his devotional service he is helped by
Kåñëa Himself within his heart. So the sincere devotee engaged in Kåñëa
consciousness cannot be without knowledge. The only qualification is that one
carry out devotional service in full Kåñëa consciousness.

The modern philosophers think that without discriminating one cannot have pure
knowledge. For them this answer is given by the Supreme Lord: those who are
engaged in pure devotional service, even though they be without sufficient
education and even without sufficient knowledge of the Vedic principles, are
still helped by the Supreme God, as stated in this verse.

The Lord tells Arjuna that basically there is no possibility of understanding
the Supreme Truth, the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
simply by speculating, for the Supreme Truth is so great that it is not possible
to understand Him or to achieve Him simply by making a mental effort. Man can go
on speculating for several millions of years, and if he is not devoted, if he is
not a lover of the Supreme Truth, he will never understand Kåñëa or the Supreme
Truth. Only by devotional service is the Supreme Truth, Kåñëa, pleased, and by
His inconceivable energy He can reveal Himself to the heart of the pure devotee.
The pure devotee always has Kåñëa within his heart; therefore he is just like
the sun that dissipates the darkness of ignorance. This is the special mercy
rendered to the pure devotee by Kåñëa.

Due to the contamination of material association, through many, many millions of
births, one’s heart is always covered with the dust of materialism, but when one
engages in devotional service and constantly chants Hare Kåñëa, the dust quickly
clears, and one is elevated to the platform of pure knowledge. The ultimate goal
of Viñëu can be attained only by this chant and by devotional service, and not
by mental speculation or argument. The pure devotee does not have to worry about
the necessities of life; he need not be anxious because when he removes the
darkness from his heart, everything is provided automatically by the Supreme
Lord, for He is pleased by the loving devotional service of the devotee. This is
the essence of the Gétä’s teachings. By studying Bhagavad-gétä, one can become a
completely surrendered soul to the Supreme Lord and engage himself in pure
devotional service. As the Lord takes charge, one becomes completely free from
all kinds of materialistic endeavors.

Arjuna said: You are the Supreme Brahman, the ultimate, the supreme abode and
purifier, the Absolute Truth and the eternal divine person. You are the primal
God, transcendental and original, and You are the unborn and all-pervading
beauty. All the great sages such as Närada, Asita, Devala, and Vyäsa proclaim
this of You, and now You Yourself are declaring it to me.

PURPORT
In these two verses the Supreme Lord gives a chance to the modern philosopher,
for here it is clear that the Supreme is different from the individual soul.
Arjuna, after hearing the essential four verses of Bhagavad-gétä in this
chapter, became completely free from all doubts and accepted Kåñëa as the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. He at once boldly declares, “You are
Parambrahma, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.” And previously Kåñëa states
that He is the originator of everything and everyone. Every demigod and every
human being is dependant on Him. Men and demigods, out of ignorance, think that
they are absolute and independant of the Supreme Lord Kåñëa. That ignorance is
removed perfectly by the discharge of devotional service. This is already
explained in the previous verse by the Lord. Now by His grace, Arjuna is
accepting Him as the Supreme Truth, in concordance with the Vedic injunction. It
is not because Kåñëa is an intimate friend of Arjuna that he is flattering Him
by calling Him the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth. Whatever
Arjuna says in these two verses is confirmed by Vedic truth. Vedic injunctions
affirm that only one who takes to devotional service to the Supreme Lord can
understand Him, whereas others cannot. Each and every word of this verse spoken
by Arjuna is confirmed by Vedic injunction.

In the Kena Upaniñad it is stated that the Supreme Brahman is the rest for
everything, and Kåñëa has already explained that everything is resting on Him.
The Muëòaka Upaniñad confirms that the Supreme Lord, in whom everything is
resting, can be realized only by those who engage constantly in thinking of Him.
This constant thinking of Kåñëa is smaraëam, one of the methods of devotional
service. It is only by devotional service to Kåñëa that one can understand his
position and get rid of this material body.

In the Vedas the Supreme Lord is accepted as the purest of the pure. One who
understands that Kåñëa is the purest of the pure can become purified from all
sinful activities. One cannot be disinfected from sinful activities unless he
surrenders unto the Supreme Lord. Arjuna’s acceptance of Kåñëa as the supreme
pure complies with the injunctions of Vedic literature. This is also confirmed
by great personalities, of whom Närada is the chief.

Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and one should always meditate upon
Him and enjoy one’s transcendental relationship with Him. He is the supreme
existence. He is free from bodily needs, birth and death. Not only does Arjuna
confirm this, but all the Vedic literatures. the Puräëas and histories. In all
Vedic literatures Kåñëa is thus described, and the Supreme Lord Himself also
says in the Fourth Chapter, “Although I am unborn, I appear on this earth to
establish religious principles.” He is the supreme origin; He has no cause, for
He is the cause of all causes, and everything is emanating from Him. This
perfect knowledge can be had by the grace of the Supreme Lord.

Here Arjuna expresses himself through the grace of Kåñëa. If we want to
understand Bhagavad-gétä, we should accept the statements in these two verses.
This is called the paramparä system, acceptance of the disciplic succession.
Unless one is in the disciplic succession, he cannot understand Bhagavad-gétä.
It is not possible by so-called academic education. Unfortunately those proud of
their academic education, despite so much evidence in Vedic literatures, stick
to their obstinate conviction that Kåñëa is an ordinary person.

PURPORT
Arjuna herein confirms that persons of faithless and demonic nature cannot
understand Kåñëa. He is not even known by the demigods, so what to speak of the
so-called scholars of this modern world? By the grace of the Supreme Lord,
Arjuna has understood that the Supreme Truth is Kåñëa and that He is the perfect
one. One should therefore follow the path of Arjuna. He received the authority
of Bhagavad-gétä. As described in the Fourth Chapter, the paramparä system of
disciplic succession for the understanding of Bhagavad-gétä was lost, and
therefore Kåñëa reestablished that disciplic succession with Arjuna because He
considered Arjuna His intimate friend and a great devotee. Therefore, as stated
in our Introduction to Gétopaniñad, Bhagavad-gétä should be understood in the
paramparä system. When the paramparä system was lost, Arjuna was again selected
to rejuvenate it. The acceptance of Arjuna of all that Kåñëa says should be
emulated; then we can understand the essence of Bhagavad-gétä, and then only can
we understand that Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

TRANSLATION
Indeed, You alone know Yourself by Your own potencies, O origin of all, Lord of

PURPORT
The Supreme Lord Kåñëa can be known by persons who are in a relationship with
Him through the discharge of devotional service, like Arjuna and his successors.
Persons of demonic or atheistic mentality cannot know Kåñëa. Mental speculation
that leads one away from the Supreme Lord is a serious sin, and one who does not
know Kåñëa should not try to comment on Bhagavad-gétä. Bhagavad-gétä is the
statement of Kåñëa, and since it is the science of Kåñëa, it should be
understood from Kåñëa as Arjuna understood it. It should not be received from
atheistic persons.

The Supreme Truth is realized in three aspects: as impersonal Brahman, localized
Paramätmä and at last as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So at the last
stage of understanding the Absolute Truth, one comes to the Supreme Personality
of Godhead. A liberated man and even a common man may realize impersonal Brahman
or localized Paramätmä, yet they may not understand God’s personality from the
verses of Bhagavad-gétä, which are being spoken by this person, Kåñëa. Sometimes
the impersonalists accept Kåñëa as Bhagavan, or they accept His authority. Yet
many liberated persons cannot understand Kåñëa as Puruñottama, the Supreme
Person, the father of all living entities. Therefore Arjuna addresses Him as
Puruñottama. And if one comes to know Him as the father of all the living
entities, still one may not know Him as the supreme controller; therefore He is
addressed here as Bhüteça, the supreme controller of everyone. And even if one
knows Kåñëa as the supreme controller of all living entities, still one may not
know that He is the origin of all the demigods; therefore He is addressed herein
as Devadeva, the worshipful God of all demigods. And even if one knows Him as
the worshipful God of all demigods, one may not know that He is the supreme
proprietor of everything; therefore He is addressed as Jagatpati. Thus the truth
about Kåñëa is established in this verse by the realization of Arjuna, and we
should follow in the footsteps of Arjuna to understand Kåñëa as He is.

PURPORT
In this verse it appears that Arjuna is already satisfied with his understanding
of the Supreme Lord Kåñëa. By Kåñëa’s grace, Arjuna has personal experience,
intelligence and knowledge and whatever else a person may have through all these
agencies, and he has understood Kåñëa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. For
him there is no doubt, Yet he is asking Kåñëa to explain His all-pervading
nature so that in the future people will understand, especially the
impersonalists, how He exists in His all-pervading aspect through His different
energies. One should know that this is being asked by Arjuna on behalf of the
common people.

PURPORT
As it is stated in the previous chapter, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is
covered by His yoga-mäyä. Only surrendered souls and devotees can see Him. Now
Arjuna is convinced that His friend, Kåñëa, is the Supreme Godhead, but he wants
to know the general process by which the all-pervading Lord can be understood by
the common man. No common man, including the demons and atheists, can know Kåñëa
because He is guarded by His yoga-mäyä energy. Again, these questions are asked
by Arjuna for their benefit. The superior devotee is not only concerned for his
own understanding, but for the understanding of all mankind. Out of his mercy,
because he is a Vaiñëava, a devotee, Arjuna is opening the understanding for the
common man as far as the all-pervasiveness of the Supreme is concerned. He
addresses Kåñëa specifically as yogin because Çré Kåñëa is the master of the
yoga-mäyä energy by which He is covered and uncovered to the common man. The
common man who has no love for Kåñëa cannot always think of Kåñëa; therefore he
has to think materially. Arjuna is considering the mode of thinking of the
materialistic persons of this world. Because materialists cannot understand
Kåñëa spiritually, they are advised to concentrate the mind on physical things
and try to see how Kåñëa is manifested by physical representations.

Tell me again in detail, O Janärdana [Kåñëa], of Your mighty potencies and

PURPORT
A similar statement was made to Süta Gosvämé by the åñis of Naimiñäraëya, headed
by Çaunaka. That statement is:

vayaà tu na vitåpyäma uttama-çloka-vikrame
yac chåëvatäà rasa-jïänäà svädu svädu pade pade.

“One can never be satiated even though one continuously hears the transcendental
pastimes of Kåñëa, who is glorified by Vedic hymns. Those who have entered into
a transcendental relationship with Kåñëa relish in every step descriptions of
the pastimes of the Lord.” Thus Arjuna is interested to hear about Kåñëa,
specifically how He remains as the all-pervading Supreme Lord.

Now as far as amåtam, nectar, is concerned, any narration or statement
concerning Kåñëa is just like nectar. And this nectar can be perceived by
practical experience. Modern stories, fiction and histories are different from
the transcendental pastimes of the Lord in that one will tire of hearing mundane
stories, but one never tires of hearing about Kåñëa. It is for this reason only
that the history of the whole universe is replete with references to the
pastimes of the incarnations of Godhead. For instance, the Puräëas are histories
of bygone ages that relate the pastimes of the various incarnations of the Lord.
In this way the reading matter remains forever fresh, despite repeated readings.

TRANSLATION
The Blessed Lord said: Yes, I will tell you of My splendorous manifestations,
but only of those which are prominent, O Arjuna, for My opulence is limitless.

PURPORT
It is not possible to comprehend the greatness of Kåñëa and His opulences. The
senses of the individual soul are imperfect and do not permit him to understand
the totality of Kåñëa’s affairs. Still the devotees try to understand Kåñëa, but
not on the principle that they will be able to understand Kåñëa fully at any
specific time or in any state of life. Rather, the very topics of Kåñëa are so
relishable that they appear to them as nectar. Thus they enjoy them. In
discussing Kåñëa’s opulences and His diverse energies, the pure devotees take
transcendental pleasure. Therefore they want to hear and discuss them. Kåñëa
knows that living entities do not understand the extent of His opulences; He
therefore agrees to state only the principal manifestations of His different
energies. The word prädhänyataù (principal) is very important because we can
understand only a few of the principal details of the Supreme Lord, for His
features are unlimited. It is not possible to understand them all. And vibhüti,
as used in this verse, refers to the opulences by which He controls the whole
manifestation. In the Amara-koça dictionary it is stated that vibhüti indicates
an exceptional opulence.

The impersonalist or the pantheist cannot understand the exceptional opulences
of the Supreme Lord nor the manifestations of His divine energy. Both in the
material world and in the spiritual world His energies are distributed in every
variety of manifestation. Now Kåñëa is describing what can be directly perceived
by the common man; thus part of His variegated energy is described in this way.

TRANSLATION
I am the Self, O Guòäkeça, seated in the hearts of all creatures. I am the

PURPORT
In this verse Arjuna is addressed as Guòäkeça, which means one who has conquered
the darkness of sleep. For those who are sleeping in the darkness of ignorance,
it is not possible to understand how the Supreme Godhead manifests Himself in
the material and spiritual worlds. Thus this address by Kåñëa to Arjuna is
significant. Because Arjuna is above such darkness, the Personality of Godhead
agrees to describe His various opulences.

Kåñëa first informs Arjuna that He is the Self or soul of the entire cosmic
manifestation by dint of His primary expansion. Before the material creation,
the Supreme Lord, by His plenary expansion, accepts the Puruña incarnations, and
from Him everything begins. Therefore He is ätmä, the soul of the mahat-tattva,
the universal elements. The total material energy is not the cause of the
creation, but actually the Mahä-Visëu enters into the mahat-tattva, the total
material energy. He is the soul. When Mahä-Viñëu enters into the manifested
universes, He again manifests Himself as the Supersoul in each and every entity.
We have experience that the personal body of the living entity exists due to the
presence of the spiritual spark. Without the existence of the spiritual spark,
the body cannot develop. Similarly, the material manifestation cannot develop
unless the Supreme Soul of Kåñëa enters.

The Supreme Personality of Godhead is existing as the Supersoul in all
manifested universes. A description of the three puruña-avatäras is given in
Çrémad-Bhägavatam. “The Supreme Personality of Godhead manifests three features,
as Käraëodakaçäyé Visëu, Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu and Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu, in this
material manifestation.” The Supreme Lord Kåñëa, the cause of all causes, lies
down in the cosmic ocean as Mahä-Viñëu or Käraëodakaçäyé Viñëu, and therefore
Kåñëa is the beginning of this universe, the maintainer of the universal
manifestation, and the end of all the energy.

There are twelve Ädityas, of which Kåñëa is the principal. And among all the
luminaries twinkling in the sky, the sun is the chief, and in the Brahma-saàhitä
the sun is accepted as the glowing effulgence of the Supreme Lord and is
considered to be one of His eyes. Maréci is the controlling deity of the
heavenly spaces. Among the stars, the moon is most prominent at night, and thus
the moon represents Kåñëa.

TRANSLATION
Of priests, O Arjuna, know Me to be the chief, Båhaspati, the lord of devotion.
Of generals I am Skanda, the lord of war; and of bodies of water I am the ocean.

PURPORT
Indra is the chief demigod of the heavenly planets and is known as the king of
the heavens. The planet in which he reigns is called Indraloka. Båhaspati is
Indra’s priest, and since Indra is the chief of all kings, Båhaspati is the
chief of all priests. And as Indra is the chief of all kings, similarly Skanda,
the son of Pärvaté and Lord Çiva, is the chief of all military commanders. And
of all bodies of water, the ocean is the greatest. These representations of
Kåñëa only give hints of His greatness.

TRANSLATION
Of the great sages I am Bhågu; of vibrations I am the transcendental om. Of
sacrifices I am the chanting of the holy names [japa], and of immovable things I
am the Himalayas.

PURPORT
Brahmä, the first living creature within the universe, created several sons for
the propagation of various kinds of species. The most powerful of his sons is
Bhågu, who is also the greatest sage. Of all the transcendental vibrations, the
“om” (omkara) represents the Supreme. Of all the sacrifices, the chanting of
Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma,
Hare Hare is the purest representation of Kåñëa. Sometimes animal sacrifices are
recommended, but in the sacrifice of Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, there is no
question of violence. It is the simplest and the purest. Whatever is sublime in
the worlds is a representation of Kåñëa. Therefore the Himalayas, the greatest
mountains in the world, also represent Him. The mountain named Meru was
mentioned in a previous verse, but Meru is sometimes movable, whereas the
Himalayas are never movable. Thus the Himalayas are greater than Meru.

TRANSLATION
Of all trees I am the holy fig tree, and amongst sages and demigods I am Närada.
Of the singers of the gods [Gandharvas] I am Citraratha, and among perfected
beings I am the sage Kapila.

PURPORT
The fig tree (açvattha) is one of the most beautiful and highest trees, and
people in India often worship it as one of their daily morning rituals. Amongst
the demigods they also worship Närada, who is considered the greatest devotee in
the universe. Thus he is the representation of Kåñëa as a devotee. The Gandharva
planet is filled with entities who sing beautifully, and among them the best
singer is Citraratha. Amongst the perpetually living entities, Kapila is
considered an incarnation of Kåñëa, and His philosophy is mentioned in the
Çrémad-Bhägavatam. Later on another Kapila became famous, but his philosophy was
atheistic. Thus there is a gulf of difference between them.

TRANSLATION
Of horses know Me to be Uccaiùçravä, who rose out of the ocean, born of the
elixir of immortality; of lordly elephants I am Airävata, and among men I am the
monarch.

PURPORT
The devotee demigods and the demons (asuras) once took a sea journey. On this
journey, nectar and poison were produced, and Lord Çiva drank the poison. From
the nectar were produced many entities, of which there was a horse named
Uccaiùçravä. Another animal produced from the nectar was an elephant named
Airävata. Because these two animals were produced from nectar, they have special
significance, and they are representatives of Kåñëa.

Amongst the human beings, the king is the representative of Kåñëa because Kåñëa
is the maintainer of the universe, and the kings, who are appointed on account
of their godly qualifications, are maintainers of their kingdoms. Kings like
Mahäräja Yudhiñöhira, Mahäräja Parékñit and Lord Räma were all highly righteous
kings who always thought of the citizens’ welfare. In Vedic literature, the king
is considered to be the representative of God. In this age, however, with the
corruption of the principles of religion, monarchy decayed and is now finally
abolished. It is to be understood that in the past, however, people were more
happy under righteous kings.

TRANSLATION
Of weapons I am the thunderbolt; among cows I am the surabhi, givers of abundant
milk. Of procreators I am Kandarpa, the god of love, and of serpents I am
Väsuki, the chief.

PURPORT
The thunderbolt, indeed a mighty weapon, represents Kåñëa’s power. In Kåñëaloka
in the spiritual sky there are cows which can be milked at any time, and they
give as much milk as one likes. Of course such cows do not exist in this
material world, but there is mention of them in Kåñëaloka. The Lord keeps many
such cows, which are called surabhi. It is stated that the Lord is engaged in
herding the surabhi cows. Kandarpa is the sex desire for presenting good sons;
therefore Kandarpa is the representative of Kåñëa. Sometimes sex is engaged in
only for sense gratification; such sex does not represent Kåñëa. But sex for the
generation of good children is called Kandarpa and represents Kåñëa.

departed ancestors I am Aryamä, and among the dispensers of law I am Yama, lord
of death.

PURPORT
Among the many celestial Naga serpents, Ananta is the greatest, as is Varuëa
among the aquatics. They both represent Kåñëa. There is also a planet of trees
presided over by Aryamä, who represents Kåñëa. There are many living entities
who give punishment to the miscreants, and among them Yama is the chief. Yama is
situated in a planet near this earthly planet, and after death those who are
very sinful are taken there, and Yama arranges different kinds of punishments
for them.

TRANSLATION
Among the Daitya demons I am the devoted Prahläda; among subduers I am time;
among the beasts I am the lion, and among birds I am Garuòa, the feathered
carrier of Viñëu.

PURPORT
Diti and Aditi are two sisters. The sons of Aditi are called Ädityas, and the
sons of Diti are called Daityas. All the Ädityas are devotees of the Lord, and
all the Daityas are atheistic. Although Prahläda was born in the family of the
Daityas, he was a great devotee from his childhood. Because of his devotional
service and godly nature, he is considered to be a representative of Kåñëa.

There are many subduing principles, but time wears down all things in the
material universe and so represents Kåñëa. Of the many animals, the lion is the
most powerful and ferocious, and of the million varieties of birds, Garuòa, the
bearer of Lord Viñëu, is the greatest.

the shark, and of flowing rivers I am the Ganges.

PURPORT
Of all the aquatics the shark is one of the biggest and is certainly the most
dangerous to man. Thus the shark represents Kåñëa. And of rivers, the greatest
in India is the Mother Ganges. Lord Rämacandra, of the Rämäyaëa, an incarnation
of Kåñëa, is the mightest of warriors.

TRANSLATION
Of all creations I am the beginning and the end and also the middle, O Arjuna.
Of all sciences I am the spiritual science of the Self, and among logicians I am
the conclusive truth.

PURPORT
Among created manifestations, the total material elements are first created by
Mahä-Viñëu and are annihilated by Lord Çiva. Brahmä is the secondary creator.
All these created elements are different incarnations of the material qualities
of the Supreme Lord; therefore He is the beginning, the middle and the end of
all creation.

Regarding the spiritual science of the Self, there are many literatures, such as
the four Vedas, the Vedänta-sütra and the Puräëas, the Çrémad-Bhägavatam and the
Gétä. These are all representatives of Kåñëa. Among logicians there are
different stages of argument. The presentation of evidence is called japa. The
attempt to defeat one another is called vitaëòa, and the final conclusion is
called väda. The conclusive truth, the end of all reasoning processes, is Kåñëa.

TRANSLATION
Of letters I am the letter A, and among compounds I am the dual word. I am also
inexhaustable time, and of creators I am Brahmä, whose manifold faces turn
everywhere.

PURPORT
Akära, the first letter of the Sanskrit alphabet, is the beginning of the Vedic
literature. Without akära, nothing can be sounded; therefore it is the beginning
of sound. In Sanskrit there are also many compound words, of which the dual
word, like Räma-kåñëa, is called dvandvaù. For instance, Räma and Kåñëa have the
same rhythm and therefore are called dual.

Among all kinds of killers, time is the ultimate because time kills everything.
Time is the representative of Kåñëa because in due course of time there will be
a great fire and everything will be annihilated.

Among the creators and living entities, Brahmä is the chief. The various Brahmäs
exhibit four, eight, sixteen, etc., heads accordingly, and they are the chief
creators in their respective universes. The Brahmäs are representatives of
Kåñëa.

I am all-devouring death, and I am the generator of all things yet to be. Among
women I am fame, fortune, speech, memory, intelligence, faithfulness and
patience.

PURPORT
As soon as a man is born, he dies at every moment. Thus death is devouring every
living entity at every moment, but the last stroke is called death itself. That
death is Kåñëa. All species of life undergo six basic changes. They are born,
they grow, they remain for some time, they reproduce, they dwindle and finally
vanish. Of these changes, the first is deliverance from the womb, and that is
Kåñëa. The first generation is the beginning of all future activities.

The six opulences listed are considered to be feminine. If a woman possesses all
of them or some of them she becomes glorious. Sanskrit is a perfect language and
is therefore very glorious. After studying, if one can remember the subject
matter, he is gifted with good memory, or småti One need not read many books on
different subject matters; the ability to remember a few and quote them when
necessary is also another opulence.

TRANSLATION
Of hymns I am the Båhat-säma sung to the Lord Indra, and of poetry I am the
Gäyatré verse, sung daily by brähmaëas. Of months I am November and December,
and of seasons I am flower-bearing spring.

PURPORT
It has already been explained by the Lord that amongst all the Vedas, the
Säma-veda is rich with beautiful songs played by the various demigods.

One of these songs is the Båhat-säma, which has an exquisite melody and is sung
at midnight.

In Sanskrit, there are definite rules that regulate poetry; rhyme and meter are
not written whimsically, as in much modern poetry. Amongst the regulated poetry,
the Gäyatré mantra, which is chanted by the duly qualified brähmaëas, is the
most prominent. The Gäyatré mantra is mentioned in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam.
Because the Gäyatré mantra is especially meant for God realization, it
represents the Supreme Lord. This mantra is meant for spiritually advanced
people, and when one attains success in chanting it, he can enter into the
transcendental position of the Lord. One must first acquire the qualities of the
perfectly situated person, the qualities of goodness according to the laws of
material nature, in order to chant the Gäyatré mantra. The Gäyatré mantra is
very important in Vedic civilization and is considered to be the sound
incarnation of Brahman. Brahmä is its initiator, and it is passed down from him
in disciplic succession.

The months of November and December are considered the best of all months
because in India grains are collected from the fields at this time, and the
people become very happy. Of course spring is a season universally liked because
it is neither too hot nor too cold, and the flowers and trees blossom and
flourish. In spring there are also many ceremonies commemorating Kåñëa’s
pastimes; therefore this is considered to be the most joyful of all seasons, and
it is the representative of the Supreme Lord Kåñëa.

I am also the gambling of cheats, and of the splendid I am the splendor. I am
victory, I am adventure, and I am the strength of the strong.

PURPORT
There are many kinds of cheaters all over the universe. Of all cheating
processes, gambling stands supreme and therefore represents Kåñëa. As the
Supreme, Kåñëa can be more deceitful than any mere man. If Kåñëa chooses to
deceive a person, no one can surpass Him in His deceit. His greatness is not
simply one-sided—it is all-sided.

Among the victorious, He is victory. He is the splendor of the splendid. Among
enterprising industrialists, He is the most enterprising. Among adventurers, He
is the most adventurous, and among the strong, He is the strongest. When Kåñëa
was present on earth, no one could surpass Him in strength. Even in His
childhood He lifted Govardhana Hill. No one can surpass Him in cheating, no one
can surpass Him in splendor, no one can surpass Him in victory, no one can
surpass Him in enterprise, and no one can surpass Him in strength.

TRANSLATION
Of the descendants of Våñëi I am Väsudeva, and of the Päëòavas I am Arjuna. Of
the sages I am Vyäsa, and among great thinkers I am Uçanä.

PURPORT
Kåñëa is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead, and Väsudeva is the
immediate expansion of Kåñëa. Both Lord Kåñëa and Baladeva appear as the sons of
Vasudeva. Amongst the sons of Päëòu, Arjuna is famous and valiant. Indeed, he is
the best of men and therefore represents Kåñëa. Among the munis, or learned men
conversant in Vedic knowledge, Vyäsa is the greatest because he explained Vedic
knowledge in many different ways for the understanding of the common mass of
people in this age of Kali. And Vyäsa is also known as an incarnation of Kåñëa;
therefore Vyäsa also represents Kåñëa. Kavis are those who are capable of
thinking thoroughly on any subject matter. Among the kavis, Uçanä was the
spiritual master of the demons; he was extremely intelligent, far-seeing,
political and spiritual in every way. Thus Uçanä is another representative of
the opulence of Kåñëa.

PURPORT
There are many suppressing agents, of which the most important are those that
cut down the miscreants. When miscreants are punished, the rod of chastisement
represents Kåñëa. Among those who are trying to be victorious in some field of
activity, the most victorious element is morality. Among the confidential
activities of hearing, thinking and meditating, silence is most important
because by silence one can make progress very quickly. The wise man is he who
can discriminate between matter and spirit, between God’s superior and inferior
natures. Such knowledge is Kåñëa Himself.

Everything has a cause, and that cause or seed of manifestation is Kåñëa.
Without Kåñëa’s energy, nothing can exist; therefore He is called omnipotent.
Without His potency, neither the movable nor the unmovable can exist. Whatever
existence is not founded on the energy of Kåñëa is called mäyä, that which is
not.

As stated in the Vedic literature, although the opulences and energies of the

PURPORT
Any glorious or beautiful existence should be understood to be but a fragmental
manifestation of Kåñëa’s opulence, whether it be in the spiritual or material
world. Anything extraordinarily opulent should be considered to represent
Kåñëa’s opulence.

TRANSLATION
But what need is there, Arjuna, for all this detailed knowledge? With a single
fragment of Myself I pervade and support this entire universe.

PURPORT
The Supreme Lord is represented throughout the entire material universes by His
entering into all things as the Supersoul. The Lord here tells Arjuna that there
is no point in understanding how things exist in their separate opulence and
grandeur. He should know that all things are existing due to Kåñëa’s entering
them as Supersoul. From Brahmä, the most gigantic entity, on down to the
smallest ant, all are existing because the Lord has entered each and all and is
sustaining them.

Worship of demigods is discouraged herein because even the greatest demigods
like Brahmä and Çiva only represent part of the opulence of the Supreme Lord. He
is the origin of everyone born, and no one is greater than Him. He is samatä,
which means that no one is superior to Him and that no one is equal to Him. In
the Viñëu-mantra it is said that one who considers the Supreme Lord Kåñëa in the
same category with demigods—be they even Brahmä or Çiva—becomes at once an
atheist. If, however, one thoroughly studies the different descriptions of the
opulences and expansions of Kåñëa’s energy, then one can understand without any
doubt the position of Lord Çré Kåñëa and can fix his mind in the worship of
Kåñëa without deviation. The Lord is all-pervading by the expansion of His
partial representation, the Supersoul, who enters into everything that is. Pure
devotees, therefore, concentrate their minds in Kåñëa consciousness in full
devotional service; therefore they are always situated in the transcendental
position. Devotional service and worship of Kåñëa are very clearly indicated in
this chapter in verses eight to eleven. That is the way of pure devotional
service. How one can attain the highest devotional perfection of association
with the Supreme Personality of Godhead has been thoroughly explained in this
chapter.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Tenth Chapter of the
Çrémad-Bhagavad-gétä in the matter of the Opulence of the Absolute.


CHAPTER ELEVEN

The Universal Form

TEXT 1
arjuna uväca
mad-anugrahäya paramaà
guhyam adhyätma-saàjïitam
yat tvayoktaà vacas tena
moho ’yaà vigato mama

arjunaù uväca—Arjuna said; mat-anugrahäya—just to show me favor;
paramam—supreme; guhyam—confidential; adhyätma—spiritual; saàjïitam—in the
matter of; yat—what; tvayä—by You; uktam—said; vacaù—words; tena—by that;
mohaù—illusion; ayam—this; vigataù—is educated; mama—my.

TRANSLATION
Arjuna said: I have heard Your instruction on confidential spiritual matters
which You have so kindly delivered unto me, and my illusion is now dispelled.

PURPORT
This chapter reveals Kåñëa as the cause of all causes. He is even the cause of
the Mahä-Viñëu, and from Him the material universes emanate. Kåñëa is not an
incarnation; He is the source of all incarnations. That has been completely
explained in the last chapter.

Now, as far as Arjuna is concerned, he says that his illusion is over. This
means that Arjuna no longer thinks of Kåñëa as a mere human being, as a friend
of his, but as the source of everything. Arjuna is very enlightened and is glad
that he has a great friend like Kåñëa, but now he is thinking that although he
may accept Kåñëa as the source of everything, others may not. So in order to
establish Kåñëa’s divinity for all, he is requesting Kåñëa in this chapter to
show His universal form. Actually when one sees the universal form of Kåñëa one
becomes frightened, like Arjuna, but Kåñëa is so kind that after showing it He
converts Himself again into His original form. Arjuna agrees to what Kåñëa says
several times. Kåñëa is speaking to him just for his benefit, and Arjuna
acknowledges that all this is happening to him by Kåñëa’s grace. He is now
convinced that Kåñëa is the cause of all causes and is present in everyone’s
heart as the Supersoul.


TEXT 2
bhaväpyayau hi bhütänäà
çrutau vistaraço mayä
tvattaù kamala-paträkña
mähätmyam api cävyayam

bhava—appearance; apyayau—disappearance; hi—certainly; bhütänäm—of all living
entities; çrutau—have heard; vistaraçaù—detail; mayä—by me; tvattaù—from You;
kamala-paträkña—O lotus-eyed one; mähätmyam—glories; api—also; ca—and;
avyayam—inexhaustible.

TRANSLATION
O lotus-eyed one, I have heard from You in detail about the appearance and
disappearance of every living entity, as realized through Your inexhaustible
glories.

PURPORT
Arjuna addresses Lord Kåñëa as “lotus-eyed” (Kåñëa’s eyes appear just like the
petals of a lotus flower) out of his joy, for Kåñëa has assured him, in the last
verse of the previous chapter, that He sustains the entire universe with just a
fragment of Himself. He is the source of everything in this material
manifestation, and Arjuna has heard of this from the Lord in detail. Arjuna
further knows that in spite of His being the source of all appearances and
disappearances, He is aloof from them. His personality is not lost, although He
is all-pervading. That is the inconceivable opulence of Kåñëa which Arjuna
admits that he has thoroughly understood.


TEXT 3
evam etad yathättha tvam
ätmänaà parameçvara
drañöum icchämi te rüpam
aiçvaraà puruñottama

evam—that; etat—this; yathättha—as it is; tvam—You; ätmänam—the soul;
parameçvara—the Supreme Lord; drañöum—to see; icchämi—I wish; te—You;
rüpam—form; aiçvaram—divine; puruñottama—O best of personalities.

TRANSLATION
O greatest of all personalities, O supreme form, though I see here before me
Your actual position, I yet wish to see how You have entered into this cosmic
manifestation. I want to see that form of Yours.

PURPORT
The Lord said that because He entered into the material universe by His personal
representation, the cosmic manifestation has been made possible and is going on.
Now as far as Arjuna is concerned, he is inspired by the statements of Kåñëa,
but in order to convince others in the future who may think that Kåñëa is an
ordinary person, he desires to see Him actually in His universal form, to see
how He is acting from within the universe, although He is apart from it.
Arjuna’s asking the Lord’s permission is also significant. Since the Lord is the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, He is present within Arjuna himself; therefore
He knows the desire of Arjuna, and He can understand that Arjuna has no special
desire to see Him in His universal form, for he is completely satisfied to see
Him in His personal form of Kåñëa. But He can understand also that Arjuna wants
to see the universal form to convince others. He did not have any personal
desire for confirmation. Kåñëa also understands that Arjuna wants to see the
universal form to set a criterion, for in the future there would be so many
imposters who would pose themselves as incarnations of God. The people,
therefore, should be careful; one who claims to be Kåñëa should be prepared to
show his universal form to confirm his claim to the people.


TEXT 4
manyase yadi tac chakyaà
mayä drañöum iti prabho
yogeçvara tato me tvaà
darçayätmänam avyayam

manyase—if You think; yadi—if; tat—that; çakyam—able to see; mayä—by me;
drañöum—to see; iti—thus; prabho—O Lord; yogeçvara—the Lord of all mystic power;
tataù—then; me—unto me; tvam—You; darçaya—show; ätmänam—Yourself;
avyayam—eternal.

TRANSLATION
If You think that I am able to behold Your cosmic form, O my Lord, O master of
all mystic power, then kindly show me that universal self.

PURPORT
It is said that one can neither see, hear, understand nor perceive the Supreme
Lord, Kåñëa, by the material senses. But if one is engaged in loving
transcendental service to the Lord from the beginning, then one can see the Lord
by revelation. Every living entity is only a spiritual spark; therefore it is
not possible to see or to understand the Supreme Lord. Arjuna, as a devotee,
does not depend on his speculative strength; rather, he admits his limitations
as a living entity and acknowledges Kåñëa’s inestimable position. Arjuna could
understand that for a living entity it is not possible to understand the
unlimited infinite. If the infinite reveals Himself, then it is possible to
understand the nature of the infinite by the grace of the infinite. The word
yogeçvara is also very significant here because the Lord has inconceivable
power. If He likes, He can reveal Himself by His grace, although He is
unlimited. Therefore Arjuna pleads for the inconceivable grace of Kåñëa. He does
not give Kåñëa orders. Kåñëa is not obliged to reveal Himself to anyone unless
one surrenders fully in Kåñëa consciousness and engages in devotional service.
Thus it is not possible for persons who depend on the strength of their mental
speculations to see Kåñëa.


TEXT 5

paçya me pärtha rüpäëi
çataço ’tha sahasraçaù
nänä-vidhäni divyäni
nänä-varëäkåténi ca

çré bhagavän uväca—the Supreme Personality of Godhead said; paçya—just see;
me—Mine; pärtha—O son of Påthä; rüpäëi—forms; çataçaù—hundreds; atha—also;
sahasraçaù—thousands; nänä-vidhäni—variegated; divyäni—divine; nänä—variegated;
varëa—colored; akåténi—forms; ca—also.

TRANSLATION
The Blessed Lord said: My dear Arjuna, O son of Påthä, behold now My opulences,
hundreds of thousands of varied divine forms, multicolored like the sea.

PURPORT
Arjuna wanted to see Kåñëa in His universal form, which, although a
transcendental form, is just manifested for the cosmic manifestation and is
therefore subject to the temporary time of this material nature. As the material
nature is manifested and not manifested, similarly this universal form of Kåñëa
is manifested and unmanifested. It is not eternally situated in the spiritual
sky like Kåñëa’s other forms. As far as a devotee is concerned, he is not eager
to see the universal form, but because Arjuna wanted to see Kåñëa in this way,
Kåñëa reveals this form. This universal form is not possible to be seen by any
ordinary man. Kåñëa must give one the power to see it.


TEXT 6
paçyädityän vasün rudrän
açvinau marutas tathä
bahüny adåñöa-pürväëi
paçyäçcaryäëi bhärata

paçya—see; ädityän—the twelve sons of Aditi; vasün—the eight Vasus; rudrän—the
eleven forms of Rudra; açvinau—the two Asvins; marutaù—the forty-nine Maruts
(demigods of the wind); tathä—also; bahüni—many; adåñöa—that you have not heard
or seen; pürväëi—before; paçya—there see; äçcaryäëi—all the wonderful; bhärata—O
best of the Bhäratas.

TRANSLATION
O best of the Bhäratas, see here the different manifestations of Ädityas,
Rudras, and all the demigods. Behold the many things which no one has ever seen
or heard before.

PURPORT
Even though Arjuna was a personal friend of Kåñëa and the most advanced of
learned men, it was still not possible for him to know everything about Kåñëa.
Here it is stated that humans have neither heard nor known of all these forms
and manifestations. Now Kåñëa reveals these wonderful forms.


TEXT 7
ihaika-sthaà jagat kåtsnaà
paçyädya sa-caräcaram
mama dehe guòäkeça
yac cänyad drañöum icchasi

iha—in this; ekastham—in one; jagat—the universe; kåtsnam—completely; paçya—see;
adya—immediately; sa—with; cara—moving; acaram—not moving; mama—My; dehe—in this
body; guòäkeça—O Arjuna; yat—that; ca—also; anyat—other; drañöum—to see;
icchasi—you like.

TRANSLATION
Whatever you wish to see can be seen all at once in this body. This universal
form can show you all that you now desire, as well as whatever you may desire in
the future. Everything is here completely.

PURPORT
No one can see the entire universe sitting in one place. Even the most advanced
scientist cannot see what is going on in other parts of the universe. Kåñëa
gives him the power to see anything he wants to see, past, present and future.
Thus by the mercy of Kåñëa, Arjuna is able to see everything.


TEXT 8
na tu mäà çakyase drañöum

na—never; tu—but; mäm—Me; çakyase—able; drañöum—to see; anena—by this;
eva—certainly; sva-cakñuñä—with your own eyes; divyam—divine; dadämi—I give;
te—you; cakñuù—eyes; paçya—see; me—My; yogam aiçvaram—inconceivable mystic
power.

TRANSLATION
But you cannot see Me with your present eyes. Therefore I give to you divine
eyes by which you can behold My mystic opulence.

PURPORT
A pure devotee does not like to see Kåñëa in any form except His form with two
hands; a devotee must see His universal form by His grace, not with the mind but
with spiritual eyes. To see the universal form of Kåñëa, Arjuna is told not to
change his mind but his vision. The universal form of Kåñëa is not very
important; that will be clear in the verses. Yet because Arjuna wanted to see
it, the Lord gives him the particular vision required to see that universal
form.

Devotees who are correctly situated in a transcendental relationship with Kåñëa
are attracted by loving features, not by a godless display of opulences. The
playmates of Kåñëa, the friends of Kåñëa and the parents of Kåñëa never want
Kåñëa to show His opulences. They are so immersed in pure love that they do not
even know that Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In their loving
exchange they forget that Kåñëa is the Supreme Lord. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam it
is stated that the boys who play with Kåñëa are all highly pious souls, and
after many, many births they are able to play with Kåñëa. Such boys do not know
that Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They take Him as a personal
friend. The Supreme Person is considered as the impersonal Brahman by great
sages, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead by the devotees, and as a product
of this material nature by ordinary men. The fact is that the devotee is not
concerned to see the viçva-rüpa, the universal form, but Arjuna wanted to see it
to substantiate Kåñëa’s statement so that in the future people could understand
that Kåñëa not only theoretically or philosophically presented Himself as the
Supreme but actually presented Himself as such to Arjuna. Arjuna must confirm
this because Arjuna is the beginning of the paramparä system. Those who are
actually interested to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, and
who follow in the footsteps of Arjuna should understand that Kåñëa not only
theoretically presented Himself as the Supreme, but actually revealed Himself as
the Supreme.

The Lord gave Arjuna the necessary power to see His universal form because He
knew that Arjuna did not particularly want to see it, as we have already
explained.

Godhead, Kåñëa; darçayämäsa—showed; pärthäya—unto Arjuna; paramam—divine;
rüpam—universal form; aiçvaram—opulences.

TRANSLATION
Saïjaya said: O King, speaking thus, the Supreme, the Lord of all mystic power,
the Personality of Godhead, displayed His universal form to Arjuna.

TRANSLATION
Arjuna saw in that universal form unlimited mouths and unlimited eyes. It was
all wondrous. The form was decorated with divine, dazzling ornaments and arrayed
in many garbs. He was garlanded gloriously, and there were many scents smeared
over His body. All was magnificent, all-expanding, unlimited. This was seen by
Arjuna.

PURPORT
These two verses indicate that there is no limit to the hands, mouths, legs,
etc., of the Lord. These manifestations are distributed throughout the universe
and are unlimited. By the grace of the Lord, Arjuna could see them while sitting
in one place. That is due to the inconceivable potency of Kåñëa.


TEXT 12
divi sürya-sahasrasya

divi—in the sky; sürya—sun; sahasrasya—of many thousands; bhavet—there were;
yugapat—simultaneously; utthitä—present; yadi—if; bhäù—light; sadåçé—like that;
sä—that; syät—may be; bhäsaù—effulgence; tasya—there is; mahätmanaù—of the great
Lord.

TRANSLATION
If hundreds of thousands of suns rose up at once into the sky, they might
resemble the effulgence of the Supreme Person in that universal form.

PURPORT
What Arjuna saw was indescribable, yet Saïjaya is trying to give a mental
picture of that great revelation to Dhåtaräñöra. Neither Saïjaya nor Dhåtaräñöra
were present, but Saïjaya, by the grace of Vyäsa, could see whatever happened.
Thus he now compares the situation, as far as it can be understood, to an
imaginable phenomenon (i.e. thousands of suns).


TEXT 13
tatraika-sthaà jagat kåtsnaà

tatra—there; ekastham—one place; jagat—universe; kåtsnam—completely;
pravibhaktam—divided in; anekadhä—many kinds; apaçyat—could see; deva-devasya—of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead; çarére—in the universal form;
päëòavaù—Arjuna; tadä—at that time.

TRANSLATION
At that time Arjuna could see in the universal form of the Lord the unlimited
expansions of the universe situated in one place although divided into many,
many thousands.

PURPORT
The word tatra (there) is very significant. It indicates that both Arjuna and
Kåñëa were sitting on the chariot when Arjuna saw the universal form. Others on
the battlefield could not see this form because Kåñëa gave the vision only to
Arjuna. Arjuna could see in the body of Kåñëa many thousands of universes. As we
learn from Vedic scriptures, there are many universes and many planets. Some of
them are made of earth, some are made of gold, some are made of jewels, some are
very great, some are not so great, etc. Sitting on his chariot, Arjuna could see
all these universes. But no one could understand what was going on between
Arjuna and Kåñëa.


TEXT 14

tataù—thereafter; saù—he; vismayäviñöaù—being overwhelmed with wonder;
håñöa-romä—with his bodily hairs standing on end due to his great ecstasy;
dhanaïjayaù—Arjuna ; praëamya—offering obeisances; çirasä—with the head;
devam—to the Supreme Personality of Godhead; kåtäïjaliù—with folded hands;
abhäñata—began to say.

TRANSLATION
Then, bewildered and astonished, his hair standing on end, Arjuna began to pray
with folded hands, offering obeisances to the Supreme Lord.

PURPORT
Once the divine vision is revealed, the relationship between Kåñëa and Arjuna
changes immediately. Before, Kåñëa and Arjuna had a relationship based on
friendship, but here, after the revelation, Arjuna is offering obeisances with
great respect, and with folded hands he is praying to Kåñëa. He is praising the
universal form. Thus Arjuna’s relationship becomes one of wonder rather than
friendship. Great devotees see Kåñëa as the reservoir of all relationships. In
the scriptures there are twelve basic kinds of relationships mentioned, and all
of them are present in Kåñëa. It is said that He is the ocean of all the
relationships exchanged between two living entities, between the gods, or
between the Supreme Lord and His devotees.

It is said that Arjuna was inspired by the relationship of wonder, and in that
wonder, although he was by nature very sober, calm and quiet, he became
ecstatic, his hair stood up, and he began to offer his obeisances unto the
Supreme Lord with folded hands. He was not, of course, afraid. He was affected
by the wonders of the Supreme Lord. The immediate context is wonder; his natural
loving friendship was overwhelmed by wonder, and thus he reacted in this way.

arjunaù uväca—Arjuna said; paçyämi—I see; devän—all the demigods; tava—Your;
deva—O Lord; dehe—in the body; sarvän—all; tathä—also; bhüta—living entities;
viçeña-saìghän—specifically assembled; brahmäëam—Lord Brahmä; éçam—Lord Çiva;
kamala-äsana-stham—sitting on the lotus flower; åñén—great sages; ca—also;

TRANSLATION
Arjuna said: My dear Lord Kåñëa, I see assembled together in Your body all the
demigods and various other living entities. I see Brahmä sitting on the lotus
flower as well as Lord Çiva and many sages and divine serpents.

PURPORT
Arjuna sees everything in the universe; therefore he sees Brahmä, who is the
first creature in the universe, and the celestial serpent upon which the
Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu lies in the lower regions of the universe. This snake bed
is called Väsuki. There are also other snakes known as Väsuki. Arjuna can see
from the Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu up to the topmost part of the universe on the
lotus-flower planet where Brahmä, the first creature of the universe, resides.
That means that from the beginning to the end, everything could be seen by
Arjuna sitting in one place on his chariot. This was possible by the grace of
the Supreme Lord, Kåñëa.

O Lord of the universe, I see in Your universal body many, many forms—bellies,
mouths, eyes—expanded without limit. There is no end, there is no beginning, and
there is no middle to all this.

PURPORT
Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and is unlimited; thus through Him
everything could be seen.

Your form, adorned with various crowns, clubs and discs, is difficult to see
because of its glaring effulgence, which is fiery and immeasurable like the sun.

You are the supreme primal objective; You are the best in all the universes; You
are inexhaustible, and You are the oldest; You are the maintainer of religion,
the eternal Personality of Godhead.

TRANSLATION
You are the origin without beginning, middle or end. You have numberless arms,
and the sun and moon are among Your great unlimited eyes. By Your own radiance
You are heating this entire universe.

PURPORT
There is no limit to the extent of the six opulences of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead. Here and in many other places there is repetition, but according to
the scriptures, repetition of the glories of Kåñëa is not a literary weakness.
It is said that at a time of bewilderment or wonder or of great ecstasy,
statements are repeated over and over. That is not a flaw.

TRANSLATION
Although You are one, You are spread throughout the sky and the planets and all
space between. O great one, as I behold this terrible form, I see that all the
planetary systems are perplexed.

PURPORT
Dyäv äpåthivyoù (the space between heaven and earth) and lokatrayam (three
worlds) are significant words in this verse because it appears that not only
Arjuna saw this universal form of the Lord, but others in other planetary
systems also saw it. The vision was not a dream. All who were spiritually awake
with the divine vision saw it.

Your fearful teeth. I see that some are being crushed between Your teeth as
well.

PURPORT
In a previous verse the Lord promised to show Arjuna things he would by very
interested in seeing. Now Arjuna sees that the leaders of the opposite party
(Bhéñma, Droëa, Karëa and all the sons of Dhåtaräñöra) and their soldiers and
Arjuna’s own soldiers are all being annihilated. This is an indication that
Arjuna will emerge victorious in battle, despite heavy losses on both sides. It
is also mentioned here that Bhéñma, who is supposed to be unconquerable, will
also be smashed. So also Karëa. Not only will the great warriors of the other
party like Bhéñma be smashed, but some of the great warriors of Arjuna’s side
also.

TRANSLATION
The Blessed Lord said: Time I am, destroyer of the worlds, and I have come to
engage all people. With the exception of you [the Päëòavas], all the soldiers
here on both sides will be slain.

PURPORT
Although Arjuna knew that Kåñëa was his friend and the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, he was nonetheless puzzled by the various forms exhibited by Kåñëa.
Therefore he asked further about the actual mission of this devastating force.
It is written in the Vedas that the Supreme Truth destroys everything, even
Brahmä. Yasya brahme ca kñatram ca ubhe bhavata odanaù/måtyur yasyopasecanaà ka
itthä veda yatra saù. Eventually all the brähmaëas, kñatriyas and everyone else
are devoured by the Supreme. This form of the Supreme Lord is an all-devouring
giant, and here Kåñëa presents Himself in that form of all-devouring time.
Except for a few Päëòavas, everyone who was present in that battlefield would be
devoured by Him.

Arjuna was not in favor of the fight, and he thought it was better not to fight;
then there would be no frustration. In reply, the Lord is saying that even if he
did not fight, every one of them would be destroyed, for that is His plan. If he
stopped fighting, they would die in another way. Death cannot be checked, even
if he did not fight. In fact, they were already dead. Time is destruction, and
all manifestations are to be vanquished by the desire of the Supreme Lord. That
is the law of nature.

tasmät—therefore; tväm—you; uttiñöha—get up; yaçaù—fame; labhasva—gain;
jitvä—conquering; çatrün—enemies; bhuìkñva—enjoy; räjyam—kingdom;
samåddham—flourishing; mayä—by Me; eva—certainly; ete—all these; nihatäù—already
killed; pürvam eva—by previous elements; nimitta-mätram—just become the cause;

TRANSLATION
Therefore get up and prepare to fight. After conquering your enemies you will
enjoy a flourishing kingdom. They are already put to death by My arrangement,
and you, O Savyasäcin, can be but an instmment in the fight.

PURPORT
Savyasäcin refers to one who can shoot arrows very expertly in the field; thus
Arjuna is addressed as an expert warrior capable of delivering arrows to kill
his enemies. “Just become an instrument”: nimitta-mätram. This word is also very
significant. The whole world is moving according to the plan of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. Foolish persons who do not have sufficient knowledge
think that nature is moving without a plan and all manifestations are but
accidental formations. There are many so-called scientists who suggest that
perhaps it was like this, or maybe like that, but there is no question of
“perhaps” and “maybe.” There is a specific plan being carried out in this
material world. What is this plan? This cosmic manifestation is a chance for the
conditioned souls to go back to Godhead, back to home. As long they have the
domineering mentality which makes them try to lord it over material nature, they
are conditioned. But anyone who can understand the plan of the Supreme Lord and
cultivate Kåñëa consciousness is most intelligent. The creation and destruction
of the cosmic manifestation are under the superior guidance of God. Thus the
Battle of Kurukñetra was fought according to the plan of God. Arjuna was
refusing to fight, but he was told that he should fight and at the same time
desire the Supreme Lord. Then he would be happy. If one is in full Kåñëa
consciousness and if his life is devoted to His transcendental service, he is
perfect.

TRANSLATION
The Blessed Lord said: All the great warriors—Droëa, Bhéñma, Jayadratha,
Karëa—are already destroyed. Simply fight, and you will vanquish your enemies.

PURPORT
Every plan is made by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but He is so kind and
merciful to His devotees that He wants to give the credit to His devotees who
carry out His plan according to His desire. Life should therefore move in such a
way that everyone acts in Kåñëa consciousness and understands the Supreme
Personality of Godhead through the medium of a spiritual master. The plans of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead are understood by His mercy, and the plans of
the devotees are as good as His plans. One should follow such plans and be
victorious in the struggle for existence.

Saïjaya said to Dhåtaräñöra: O King, after hearing these words from the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Arjuna trembled, fearfully offered obeisances with
folded hands and began, falteringly, to speak as follows:

PURPORT
As we have already explained, because of the situation created by the universal
form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Arjuna became bewildered in wonder;
thus he began to offer his respectful obeisances to Kåñëa again and again, and
with faltering voice he began to pray, not as a friend, but as a devotee in
wonder.

TRANSLATION
O Håñékeça, the world becomes joyful upon hearing Your name and thus everyone
becomes attached to You. Although the perfected beings offer You their
respectful homage, the demons are afraid, and they flee here and there. All this
is rightly done.

PURPORT
Arjuna, after hearing from Kåñëa about the outcome of the Battle of Kurukñetra,
became an enlightened devotee of the Supreme Lord. He admitted that everything
done by Kåñëa is quite fit. Arjuna confirmed that Kåñëa is the maintainer and
the object of worship for the devotees and the destroyer of the undesirables.
His actions are equally good for all. Arjuna understood herein that when the
Battle of Kurukñetra was being concluded, in outer space there were present many
demigods, siddhas, and the intelligentia of the higher planets, and they were
observing the fight because Kåñëa was present there. When Arjuna saw the
universal form of the Lord, the demigods took pleasure in it, but others, who
were demons and atheists, could not stand it when the Lord was praised. Out of
their natural fear of the devastating form of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, they fled. Kåñëa’s treatment of the devotees and the atheists is
praised by Arjuna. In all cases a devotee glorifies the Lord because he knows
that whatever He does is good for all.

the gods; jagat-niväsa—O refuge of the universe; tvam—You are;
akñaram—imperishable; sat-asat—cause and effect; tat-param—transcendental;
yat—because.

TRANSLATION
O great one, who stands above even Brahmä, You are the original master. Why
should they not offer their homage up to You, O limitless one? O refuge of the
universe, You are the invincible source, the cause of all causes, transcendental
to this material manifestation.

PURPORT
By this offering of obeisances, Arjuna indicates that Kåñëa is worshipable by
everyone. He is all-pervading, and He is the Soul of every soul. Arjuna is
addressing Kåñëa as mahätmä, which means that He is most magnanimous and
unlimited. Ananta indicates that there is nothing which is not covered by the
influence and energy of the Supreme Lord, and deveça means that He is the
controller of all demigods and is above them all. He is the center of the whole
universe. Arjuna also thought that it was fitting that all the perfect living
entities and all powerful demigods offer their respectful obeisances unto Him
because no one is greater than Him. He especially mentions that Kåñëa is greater
than Brahmä because Brahmä is created by Him. Brahmä is born out of the lotus
stem grown from the navel abdomen of Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu, who is Kåñëa’s
plenary expansion; therefore Brahmä and Lord Çiva, who is born of Brahmä, and
all other demigods must offer their respectful obeisances. Thus the Lord is
respected by Lord Çiva and Brahmä and similar other demigods. The word akñaram
is very significant because this material creation is subject to destruction,
but the Lord is above this material creation. He is the cause of all causes, and
being so, He is superior to all the conditioned souls within this material
nature as well as the material cosmic manifestation itself. He is therefore the
all-great Supreme.

TRANSLATION
You are the original Personality, the Godhead. You are the only sanctuary of
this manifested cosmic world. You know everything, and You are all that is
knowable. You are above the material modes. O limitless form! This whole cosmic
manifestation is pervaded by You!

PURPORT
Everything is resting on the Supreme Personality of Godhead; therefore He is the
ultimate rest. Nidhänam means that everything, even the Brahman effulgence,
rests on the Supreme Personality of Godhead Kåñëa. He is the knower of
everything that is happening in this world, and if knowledge has any end, He is
the end of all knowledge; therefore He is the known and the knowable. He is the
object of knowledge because He is all-pervading. Because He is the cause in the
spiritual world, He is transcendental. He is also the chief personality in the
transcendental world.

You are air, fire, water, and You are the moon! You are the supreme controller
and the grandfather. Thus I offer my respectful obeisances unto You a thousand
times, and again and yet again!

PURPORT
The Lord is addressed here as air because the air is the most important
representation of all the demigods, being all-pervasive. Arjuna also addresses
Kåñëa as the grandfather because He is the father of Brahmä, the first living
creature in the universe.

PURPORT
Out of loving ecstasy for Kåñëa, his friend, Arjuna is offering his respects
from all sides. He is accepting that He is the master of all potencies and all
prowess and far superior to all the great warriors assembled on the battlefield.
It is said in the Viñëu Puräëa: yo ’yaà tavägato deva-samépaà devatä-gaëaù sa
tvam eva jagat-srañöä yataù sarva-gato bhavän. “Whoever comes before You, be he
a demigod, is created by You, O Supreme Personality of Godhead.”

or in love. I have dishonored You many times while relaxing or while lying on
the same bed or eating together, sometimes alone and sometimes in front of many
friends. Please excuse me for all my offenses.

PURPORT
Although Kåñëa is manifested before Arjuna in His universal form, Arjuna
remembers his friendly relationship with Kåñëa and is therefore asking pardon
and requesting Him to excuse him for the many informal gestures which arise out
of friendship. He is admitting that formerly he did not know that Kåñëa could
assume such a universal form, although He explained it as his intimate friend.
Arjuna did not know how many times he may have dishonored Him by addressing Him
as “O my friend, O Kåñëa, O Yädava,” etc., without acknowledging His opulence.
But Kåñëa is so kind and merciful that in spite of such opulence He played with
Arjuna as a friend. Such is the transcendental loving reciprocation between the
devotee and the Lord. The relationship between the living entity and Kåñëa is
fixed eternally; it cannot be forgotten, as we can see from the behavior of
Arjuna. Although Arjuna has seen the opulence in the universal form, he could
not forget his friendly relationship with Kåñëa.

TRANSLATION
You are the father of this complete cosmic manifestation, the worshipable chief,
the spiritual master. No one is equal to You, nor can anyone be one with You.
Within the three worlds, You are immeasurable.

PURPORT
The Lord Kåñëa is worshipable as a father is worshipable for his son. He is the
spiritual master because He originally gave the Vedic instructions to Brahmä,
and presently He is also instructing Bhagavad-gétä to Arjuna; therefore He is
the original spiritual master, and any bona fide spiritual master at the present
moment must be a descendant in the line of disciplic succession stemming from
Kåñëa. Without being a representative of Kåñëa, one cannot become a teacher or
spiritual master of transcendental subject matter.

The Lord is being paid obeisances in all respects. He is of immeasurable
greatness. No one can be greater than the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa,
because no one is equal to or higher than Kåñëa within any manifestation,
spiritual or material. Everyone is below Him. No one can excel Him.

The Supreme Lord Kåñëa has senses and a body like the ordinary man, but for Him
there is no difference between His senses, body, mind and Himself. Foolish
persons who do not know Him perfectly say that Kåñëa is different from His soul,
mind, heart and everything else. Kåñëa is absolute; therefore His activities and
potencies are supreme. It is also stated that He does not have senses like ours.
He can perform all sensual activities; therefore His senses are neither
imperfect nor limited. No one can be greater than Him, no one can be equal to
Him, and everyone is lower than Him.

Whoever knows His transcendental body, activities and perfection, after quitting
his body, returns to Him and doesn’t come back again to this miserable world.
Therefore one should know that Kåñëa’s activities are different from others. The
best policy is to follow the principles of Kåñëa; that will make one perfect. It
is also stated that there is no one who is master of Kåñëa; everyone is His
servant. Only Kåñëa is God, and everyone is servant. Everyone is complying with
His order. There is no one who can deny His order. Everyone is acting according
to His direction, being under His superintendence. As stated in the
Brahmä-saàhitä, He is the cause of all causes.

friend with his friend, or a lover with his beloved.

PURPORT
Kåñëa’s devotees relate to Kåñëa in various relationships; one might treat Kåñëa
as a son, one might treat Kåñëa as a husband, as a friend, as a master, etc.
Kåñëa and Arjuna are related in friendship. As the father tolerates, or the
husband or master tolerates, so Kåñëa tolerates.

TRANSLATION
After seeing this universal form, which I have never seen before, I am
gladdened, but at the same time my mind is disturbed with fear. Therefore please
bestow Your grace upon me and reveal again Your form as the Personality of
Godhead, O Lord of lords, O abode of the universe.

PURPORT
Arjuna is always in confidence with Kåñëa because he is a very dear friend, and
as a dear friend is gladdened by his friend’s opulence, Arjuna is very joyful to
see that his friend, Kåñëa, is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and can show
such a wonderful universal form. But at the same time, after seeing that
universal form, he is afraid that he has committed so many offenses to Kåñëa out
of his unalloyed friendship. Thus his mind is disturbed out of fear, although he
had no reason to fear. Arjuna therefore is asking Kåñëa to show His Näräyaëa
form because He can assume any form. This universal form is material and
temporary, as the material world is temporary. But in the Vaikuëöha planets He
has His transcendental form with four hands as Näräyaëa. There are innumerable
planets in the spiritual sky, and in each of them Kåñëa is present by His
plenary manifestations of different names. Thus Arjuna desired to see one of the
forms manifest in the Vaikuëöha planets. Of course in each Vaikuëöha planet the
form of Näräyaëa is four-handed, and the four hands hold different symbols, the
conchshell, mace, lotus and disc. According to the different hands these four
things are held in, the Näräyaëas are named. All of these forms are one and the
same to Kåñëa; therefore Arjuna requests to see His four-handed feature.

O universal Lord, I wish to see You in Your four-armed form, with helmeted head
and with club, wheel, conch and lotus flower in Your hands. I long to see You in
that form.

PURPORT
In the Brahmä-saàhitä it is stated that the Lord is eternally situated in
hundreds and thousands of forms, and the main forms are those like Räma,
Nåsiàha, Näräyaëa, etc. There are innumerable forms. But Arjuna knew that Kåñëa
is the original Personality of Godhead assuming His temporary universal form. He
is now asking to see the form of Näräyaëa, a spiritual form. This verse
establishes without any doubt the statement of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam that Kåñëa
is the original Personality of Godhead and all other features originate from
Him. He is not different from His plenary expansions, and He is God in any of
His innumerable forms. In all of these forms He is fresh like a young man. That
is the constant feature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One who knows
Kåñëa at once becomes free from all contamination of the material world.

TRANSLATION
The Blessed Lord said: My dear Arjuna, happily do I show you this universal form
within the material world by My internal potency. No one before you has ever
seen this unlimited and glaringly effulgent form.

PURPORT
Arjuna wanted to see the universal form of the Supreme Lord, so out of His mercy
upon His devotee Arjuna, Lord Kåñëa showed His universal form full of effulgence
and opulence. This form was glaring like the sun, and its many faces were
rapidly changing. Kåñëa showed this form just to satisfy the desire of His
friend Arjuna. This form was manifested by Kåñëa through His internal potency,
which is inconceivable by human speculation. No one had seen this universal form
of the Lord before Arjuna, but because the form was shown to Arjuna, other
devotees in the heavenly planets and in other planets in outer space could also
see it. They did not see it before, but because of Arjuna they were also able to
see it. In other words, all the disciplic devotees of the Lord could see the
universal form which was shown to Arjuna by the mercy of Kåñëa. Someone
commented that this form was shown to Duryodhana also when Kåñëa went to
Duryodhana to negotiate for peace. Unfortunately, Duryodhana did not accept the
peace offer, but at that time Kåñëa manifested some of His universal forms. But
those forms are different from this one shown to Arjuna. It is clearly said that
no one has ever seen this form before.

TRANSLATION
O best of the Kuru warriors, no one before you has ever seen this universal form
of Mine, for neither by studying the Vedas, nor by performing sacrifices, nor by
charities or similar activities can this form be seen. Only you have seen this.

PURPORT
The divine vision in this connection should be clearly understood. Who can have
divine vision? Divine means godly. Unless one attains the status of divinity as
a demigod, he cannot have divine vision. And what is a demigod? It is stated in
the Vedic scriptures that those who are devotees of Lord Viñëu are demigods.
Those who are atheistic, i.e., who do not believe in Viñëu, or who only
recognize the impersonal part of Kåñëa as the Supreme, cannot have the divine
vision. It is not possible to decry Kåñëa and at the same time have the divine
vision. One cannot have the divine vision without becoming divine. In other
words, those who have divine vision can also see like Arjuna.

The Bhagavad-gétä gives the description of the universal form, and this
description was unknown to everyone before Arjuna. Now one can have some idea of
the viçva-rüpa after this incidence; those who are actually divine can see the
universal form of the Lord. But one cannot be divine without being a pure
devotee of Kåñëa. The devotees, however, who are actually in the divine nature
and who have divine vision, are not very much interested to see the universal
form of the Lord. As described in the previous verse, Arjuna desired to see the
four-handed form of Lord Kåñëa as Viñëu, and he was actually afraid of the
universal form.

In this verse there are some significant words, just like veda-yajïädhya-yanaiù,
which refers to studying Vedic literature and the subject matter of sacrificial
regulations. Veda refers to all kinds of Vedic literature, namely the four Vedas
(Åk, Yajus, Säma and Atharva) and the eighteen Puräëas and Upaniñads, and
Vedänta-sütra. One can study these at home or anywhere else. Similarly, there
are sütras, Kalpa-sütras and Mémäàsä-sütras, for studying the method of
sacrifice. Dänaiù refers to charity which is offered to a suitable party. such
as those who are engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, the
brähmaëas and the Vaiñëavas. Similarly, pious activities refer to the
agni-hotra, etc., the prescribed duties of the different castes. Pious
activities and the voluntary acceptance of some bodily pains are called tapasya.
So one can perform all these, can accept bodily penances, give charity, study
the Vedas, etc., but unless he is a devotee like Arjuna, it is not possible to
see that universal form. Those who are impersonalists are also imagining that
they are seeing the universal form of the Lord, but from Bhagavad-gétä we
understand that the impersonalists are not devotees. Therefore they are unable
to see the universal form of the Lord.

There are many persons who create incarnations. They falsely claim an ordinary
human to be an incarnation, but this is all foolishness. We should follow the
principles of Bhagavad-gétä, otherwise there is no possibility of attaining
perfect spiritual knowledge. Although Bhagavad-gétä is considered the
preliminary study of the science of God, still it is so perfect that one can
distinguish what is what. The followers of a pseudo incarnation may say that
they have also seen the transcendental incarnation of God, the universal form,
but that is not acceptable because it is clearly stated here that unless one
becomes a devotee of Kåñëa, one cannot see the universal form of God. So one
first of all has to become a pure devotee of Kåñëa; then he can claim that he
can show the universal form of what he has seen. A devotee of Kåñëa cannot
accept false incarnations or followers of false incarnations.

TRANSLATION
Your mind has been perturbed upon seeing this horrible feature of Mine. Now let
it be finished. My devotee, be free from all disturbance. With a peaceful mind
you can now see the form you desire.

PURPORT
In the beginning of Bhagavad-gétä Arjuna was worried about killing Bhéñma and
Droëa, his worshipful grandfathers and masters. But Kåñëa said that he need not
be afraid of killing his grandfather. When they tried to disrobe Draupadé in the
assembly, Bhéñma and Droëa were silent, and for such negligence of duty they
should be killed. Kåñëa showed His universal form to Arjuna just to show him
that these people were already killed for their unlawful action. That scene was
shown to Arjuna because devotees are always peaceful, and they cannot perform
such horrible actions. The purpose of the revelation of the universal form was
shown; now Arjuna wanted to see the four-armed form, and Kåñëa showed him. A
devotee is not much interested in the universal form, for it does not enable one
to reciprocate loving feelings. A devotee wants to offer his respectful
worshiping feelings; thus he wants to see the two-handed or four-handed Kåñëa
form so he can reciprocate in loving service with the Supreme Personality of
Godhead.

Saïjaya said to Dhåtaräñöra: The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, while
speaking thus to Arjuna, displayed His real four-armed form, and at last He
showed him His two-armed form, thus encouraging the fearful Arjuna.

PURPORT
When Kåñëa appeared as the son of Vasudeva and Devaké, He first of all appeared
as four-armed Näräyaëa, but when He was requested by His parents, He transformed
Himself into an ordinary child in appearance. Similarly, Kåñëa knew that Arjuna
was not interested in seeing a four-handed form of Kåñëa, but since he asked to
see this four-handed form, He also showed him this form again and then showed
Himself in His two-handed form. The word saumya-vapuù is very significant.
Saumya-vapu is a very beautiful form; it is known as the most beautiful form.
When He was present, everyone was attracted simply by Kåñëa’s form, and because
Kåñëa is director of the universe, He just banished the fear of Arjuna, His
devotee, and showed him again His beautiful form of Kåñëa. In the Brahma-saàhitä
it is stated that only a person whose eyes are smeared with the ointment of love
can see the beautiful form of Çré Kåñëa.

TRANSLATION
When Arjuna thus saw Kåñëa in His original form, he said: Seeing this humanlike
form, so very beautiful, my mind is now pacified, and I am restored to my
original nature.

PURPORT
Here the words mänuñaà rüpam clearly indicate the Supreme Personality of Godhead
to be originally two-handed. Those who deride Kåñëa to be an ordinary person are
shown here to be ignorant of His divine nature. If Kåñëa is like an ordinary
human being, then how is it possible for Him to show the universal form and
again to show the four-handed Näräyaëa form? So it is very clearly stated in
Bhagavad-gétä that one who thinks that Kåñëa is an ordinary person and misguides
the reader by claiming that it is the impersonal Brahman within Kåñëa speaking,
is doing the greatest injustice. Kåñëa has actually shown His universal form and
His fourhanded Viñëu form. So how can He be an ordinary human being? A pure
devotee is not confused by misguiding commentaries on Bhagavad-gétä because he
knows what is what. The original verses of Bhagavad-gétä are as clear as the
sun; they do not require lamplight from foolish commentators.

TRANSLATION
The Blessed Lord said: My dear Arjuna, the form which you are now seeing is very
difficult to behold. Even the demigods are ever seeking the opportunity to see
this form which is so dear.

PURPORT
In the forty-eighth verse of this chapter Lord Kåñëa concluded revealing His
universal form and informed Arjuna that this form is not possible to be seen by
so many activities, sacrifices, etc. Now here the word sudurdarçam is used,
indicating that Kåñëa’s two-handed form is still more confidential. One may be
able to see the universal form of Kåñëa by adding a little tinge of devotional
service to various activities like penance, Vedic study and philosophical
speculation, etc. It may be possible, but without a tinge of bhakti, one cannot
see; that has already been explained. Still, beyond that universal form, the
form of Kåñëa as a two-handed man is still more difficult to see, even for
demigods like Brahmä and Lord Çiva. They desire to see Him, and we have
evidences in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam that when He was supposed to be in the womb
of His mother, Devaké, all the demigods from heaven came to see the marvel of
Kåñëa. They even waited to see Him. A foolish person may deride Him, but that is
an ordinary person. Kåñëa is actually desired to be seen by demigods like Brahmä
and Çiva in His two-armed form.

In Bhagavad-gétä it is also confirmed that He is not visible to the foolish
persons who deride Him. Kåñëa’s body, as confirmed by Brahmä-saàhitä and
confirmed by Himself in Bhagavad-gétä, is completely spiritual and full of bliss
and eternality. His body is never like a material body. But for some who make a
study of Kåñëa by reading Bhagavad-gétä or similar Vedic scriptures, Kåñëa is a
problem. For one using a material process, Kåñëa is considered to be a great
historical personality and very learned philosopher. But He isn’t an ordinary
man. But some think that even though He was so powerful, He had to accept a
material body. Ultimately they think that the Absolute Truth is impersonal;
therefore they think that from His impersonal feature He assumed a personal
feature attached to material nature. This is a materialistic calculation of the
Supreme Lord. Another calculation is speculative. Those who are in search of
knowledge also speculate on Kåñëa and consider Him to be less important than the
universal form of the Supreme. Thus some think that the universal form of Kåñëa
which was manifested to Arjuna is more important than His personal form.
According to them, the personal form of the Supreme is something imaginary. They
believe that in the ultimate issue, the Absolute Truth is not a person. But the
transcendental process is described in Bhagavad-gétä, Chapter Two: to hear about
Kåñëa from authorities. That is the actual Vedic process, and those who are
actually in the Vedic line hear about Kåñëa from authority, and by repeated
hearing about Him, Kåñëa becomes dear. As we have several times discussed, Kåñëa
is covered by His yoga-mäyä potency. He is not to be seen or revealed to anyone
and everyone. Only by one to whom He reveals Himself can He be seen. This is
confirmed in Vedic literature; for one who is a surrendered soul, the Absolute
Truth can actually be understood. The transcendentalist, by continuous Kåñëa
consciousness and by devotional service to Kåñëa, can have his spiritual eyes
opened and can see Kåñëa by revelation. Such a revelation is not possible even
for the demigods; therefore it is difficult even for the demigods to understand
Kåñëa, and the advanced demigods are always in hope of seeing Kåñëa in His
two-handed form. The conclusion is that although to see the universal form of
Kåñëa is very, very difficult and not possible for anyone and everyone, it is
still more difficult to understand His personal form as Çyämasundara.

The form which you are seeing with your transcendental eyes cannot be understood

PURPORT
Kåñëa first appeared before His parents Devaké and Vasudeva in a four-handed
form, and then He transformed Himself into the two-handed form. This mystery is
very difficult to understand for those who are atheists or who are devoid of
devotional service. For scholars who have simply studied Vedic literature by way
of speculation or out of mere academic interest, Kåñëa is not easy to
understand. Nor is He to he understood by persons who officially go to the
temple to offer worship. They make their visit, but they cannot understand Kåñëa
as He is. Kåñëa can be understood only through the path of devotional service,
as explained by Kåñëa Himself in the next verse.

My dear Arjuna, only by undivided devotional service can I be understood as I
am, standing before you, and can thus be seen directly. Only in this way can you
enter into the mysteries of My understanding.

PURPORT
Kåñëa can be understood only by the process of undivided devotional service. He
explicitly explains this in this verse so unauthorized commentators, who try to
understand Bhagavad-gétä by the speculative process, will know that they are
simply wasting their time. No one can understand Kåñëa or how He came from
parents in a four-handed form and at once changed Himself into a two-handed
form. It is clearly stated here that no one can see Him. Those who, however, are
very experienced students of Vedic literature can learn about Him from the Vedic
literature in so many ways. There are so many rules and regulations, and if one
at all wants to understand Kåñëa, he must follow the regulative principles
described in the authoritative literature. One can perform penance in accordance
with those principles. As far as charity is concerned, it is plain that charity
should be given to the devotees of Kåñëa who are engaged in His devotional
service to spread the Kåñëa philosophy or Kåñëa consciousness throughout the
world. Kåñëa consciousness is a benediction to humanity. Lord Caitanya was
appreciated by Rüpa Gosvämé as the most munificent man of charity because love
of Kåñëa, which is very difficult to achieve, was distributed freely by Him. And
if one worships as prescribed in the temple (in the temples in India there is
always some statue, usually of Viñëu or Kåñëa), that is a chance to progress.
For the beginners in devotional service to the Lord, temple worship is very
essential, and this is confirmed in the Vedic literature.

One who has unflinching devotion for the Supreme Lord and is directed by the
spiritual master can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead by revelation. For
one who does not take personal training under the guidance of a bona fide
spiritual master, it is impossible to even begin to understand Kåñëa. The word
tu is specifically used here to indicate that no other process can be used, can
be recommended, or can be successful in understanding Kåñëa.

The personal forms of Kåñëa, the two-handed form and the four-handed, are
completely different from the temporary universal form shown to Arjuna. The
four-handed form is Näräyaëa, and the two-handed form is Kåñëa; they are eternal
and transcendental, whereas the universal form exhibited to Arjuna is temporary.
The very word sudurdarçam, meaning difficult to see, suggests that no one saw
that universal form. It also suggests that amongst the devotees there was no
necessity of showing it. That form was exhibited by Kåñëa at the request of
Arjuna because in the future, when one represents himself as an incarnation of
God, people can ask to see his universal form.

Kåñëa changes from the universal form to the four-handed form of Näräyaëa and
then to His own natural form of two hands. This indicates that the four-handed
forms and other forms mentioned in Vedic literature are all emanations of the
original two-handed Kåñëa. He is the origin of all emanations. Kåñëa is distinct
even from these forms, not to speak of the impersonal conception. As far as the
four-handed forms of Kåñëa are concerned, it is stated clearly that even the
most identical four-handed form of Kåñëa (which is known as Mahä-Viñëu, who is
lying on the cosmic ocean and from whose breathing so many innumerable universes
are passing out and entering) is also an expansion of the Supreme Lord.
Therefore one should conclusively worship the personal form of Kåñëa as the
Supreme Personality of Godhead who is eternity, bliss and knowledge. He is the
source of all forms of Viñëu, He is the source of all forms of incarnation, and
He is the original Supreme Personality, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä.

In the Vedic literature it is stated that the Supreme Absolute Truth is a
person. His name is Kåñëa, and He sometimes descends on this earth. Similarly,
in Çrémad-Bhägavatam there is a description of all kinds of incarnations of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, and there it is said that Kåñëa is not an
incarnation of God but is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself.
Kåñëas tu bhagavän svayam. Similarly, in Bhagavad-gétä the Lord says, mattaù
parataram nänyät: “There is nothing superior to My form as the Personality of
Godhead Kåñëa.” He also says elsewhere in Bhagavad-gétä, aham ädir hi devänäm:
“I am the origin of all the demigods.” And after understanding Bhagavad-gétä
from Kåñëa, Arjuna also confirms this in the following words: paraà brahma paraà
dhäma pavitraà paramaà bhavän: “I now fully understand that You are the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, and that You are the refuge of
everything.” Therefore the universal form which Kåñëa showed to Arjuna is not
the original form of God. The original is the Kåñëa form. The universal form,
with its thousands and thousands of heads and hands, is manifest just to draw
the attention of those who have no love for God. It is not God’s original form.

The universal form is not attractive for pure devotees, who are in love with the
Lord in different transcendental relationships. The Supreme Godhead exchanges
transcendental love in His original form of Kåñëa. Therefore to Arjuna, who was
so intimately related with Kåñëa in friendship, this form of the universal
manifestation was not pleasing; rather, it was fearful. Arjuna, who is a
constant companion of Kåñëa’s, must have had transcendental eyes; he was not an
ordinary man. Therefore he was not captivated by the universal form. This form
may seem wonderful to persons who are involved in elevating themselves by
fruitive activities, but to persons who are engaged in devotional service, the
two-handed form of Kåñëa is the most dear.

TRANSLATION
My dear Arjuna, one who is engaged in My pure devotional service, free from the
contaminations of previous activities and from mental speculation, who is
friendly to every living entity, certainly comes to Me.

PURPORT
Anyone who wants to approach the Supreme of all the Personalities of Godhead, on
the Kåñëaloka planet in the spiritual sky, and be intimately connected with the
Supreme Personality, Kåñëa, must take this formula, as is stated by the Supreme
Himself. Therefore, this verse is considered to be the essence of Bhagavad-gétä.
The Bhagavad-gétä is a book directed to the conditioned souls, who are engaged
in the material world with the purpose of lording it over nature and who do not
know of the real, spiritual life. The Bhagavad-gétä is meant to show how one can
understand his spiritual existence and his eternal relationship with the Supreme
Spiritual Personality and to teach one how to go back home, back to Godhead. Now
here is the verse which clearly explains the process by which one can attain
success in his spiritual activity: devotional service. As far as work is
concerned, one should transfer his energy entirely to Kåñëa conscious
activities. No work should be done by any man except in relationship to Kåñëa.
This called Kåñëa-karma. One may be engaged in various activities, but one
should not be attached to the result of his work, but the result should be done
for Him. For example, one may be engaged in business, but to transform that
activity into Kåñëa consciousness, one has to do business for Kåñëa. If Kåñëa is
the proprietor of the business, then Kåñëa should enjoy the profit of the
business. If a businessman is in possession of thousands and thousands of
dollars, and if he has to offer all this to Kåñëa, he can do it. This is work
for Kåñëa. Instead of constructing a big building for his sense gratification,
he can construct a nice temple for Kåñëa, and he can install the Deity of Kåñëa
and arrange for the Deity’s service, as is outlined in the authorized books of
devotional service. This is all Kåñëa-karma. One should not be attached to the
result of his work, but the result should be offered to Kåñëa. One should also
accept as prasädam, food, the remnants of offerings to Kåñëa. If, however, one
is not able to construct a temple for Kåñëa, one can engage himself in cleansing
the temple of Kåñëa; that is also Kåñëa-karma. One can cultivate a garden.
Anyone who has land—in India, at least, any poor man has a certain amount of
land—can utilize that for Kåñëa by growing flowers to offer Him. He can sow
tulasé plants because tulasé leaves are very important, and Kåñëa has
recommended this in Bhagavad-gétä. Kåñëa desires that one offer Him either a
leaf, or a flower, or a little water—and He is satisfied. This leaf especially
refers to the tulasé So one can sow tulasé leaves and pour water on the plant.
Thus, even the poorest man can engage in the service of Kåñëa. These are some of
the examples of how one can engage in working for Kåñëa.

The word mat-paramaù refers to one who considers the association of Kåñëa in His
supreme abode to be the highest perfection of life. Such a person does not wish
to be elevated to the higher planets such as the moon or sun or heavenly
planets, or even the highest planet of this universe, Brahmaloka. He has no
attraction for that. He is only attracted to being transferred to the spiritual
sky. And even in the spiritual sky he is not satisfied with merging into the
glowing brahmajyoti effulgence, for he wants to enter the highest spiritual
planet, namely Kåñëaloka, Goloka Våndävana. He has full knowledge of that
planet, and therefore he is not interested in any other. As indicated by the
word mad-bhaktaù, he fully engages in devotional service, specifically in the
nine processes of devotional engagement: hearing, chanting, remembering,
worshiping, serving the lotus feet of the Lord, offering prayers, carrying out
the orders of the Lord, making friends with Him, and surrendering everything to
Him. One can engage in all nine devotional processes, or eight, or seven, or at
least in one, and that will surely make one perfect.

The term saìga-varjitaù is very significant. One should disassociate himself
from persons who are against Kåñëa. Not only are the atheistic persons against
Kåñëa, but also those who are attracted to fruitive activities and mental
speculation. Therefore the pure form of devotional service is described in
Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu as follows: anyäbhiläñitä-çünyaà jïäna-karmädy-anävåtam
änukülyena kåñëänuçélanaà bhaktir uttamä. In this verse Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé
clearly states that if anyone wants to execute unalloyed devotional service, he
must be freed from all kinds of material contamination. He must be freed from
the association of persons who are addicted to fruitive activities and mental
speculation. When, freed from such unwanted association and from the
contamination of material desires, one favorably cultivates knowledge of Kåñëa,
that is called pure devotional service. Änukülyasya saìkaplaù prätikülyasya
varjanam. One should think of Kåñëa and act for Kåñëa favorably, not
unfavorably. Kaàsa was an enemy of Kåñëa’s. From the very beginning of Kåñëa’s
birth, he planned in so many ways to kill Him, and because he was always
unsuccessful, he was always thinking of Kåñëa. Thus while working, while eating
and while sleeping, he was always Kåñëa conscious in every respect, but that
Kåñëa consciousness was not favorable, and therefore in spite of his always
thinking of Kåñëa twenty-four hours a day, he was considered a demon, and Kåñëa
at last killed him. Of course anyone who is killed by Kåñëa attains salvation
immediately, but that is not the aim of the pure devotee. The pure devotee does
not even want salvation. He does not want to be transferred even to the highest
planet, Goloka Våndävana. His only objective is to serve Kåñëa wherever he may
be.

A devotee of Kåñëa is friendly to everyone. Therefore it is said here that he
has no enemy. How is this? A devotee situated in Kåñëa consciousness knows that
only devotional service to Kåñëa can relieve a person from all the problems of
life. He has personal experience of this, and therefore he wants to introduce
this system, Kåñëa consciousness, into human society. There are many examples in
history of devotees of the Lord risking their lives for the spreading of God
consciousness. The favorite example is Lord Jesus Christ. He was crucified by
the nondevotees, but He sacrificed His life for spreading God consciousness. Of
course, it would be superficial to understand that He was killed. Similarly, in
India also there are many examples, such as Öhäkur Haridäsa. Why such risk?
Because they wanted to spread Kåñëa consciousness, and it is difficult. A Kåñëa
conscious person knows that if a man is suffering, it is due to his
forgetfulness of his eternal relationship with Kåñëa. Therefore, the highest
benefit one can render to human society is relieving one’s neighbor from all
material problems. In such a way, a pure devotee is engaged in the service of
the Lord. Now, we can imagine how merciful Kåñëa is to those engaged in His
service, risking everything for Him. Therefore it is certain that such persons
must reach the supreme planet after leaving the body.

In summary, the universal form of Kåñëa, which is a temporary manifestation, and
the form of time which devours everything, and even the form of Viñëu,
four-handed, have all been exhibited by Kåñëa. Thus Kåñëa is the origin of all
these manifestations. It is not that Kåñëa is a manifestation of the original
viçva-rüpa, or Viñëu. Kåñëa is the origin of all forms. There are hundreds and
thousands of Viñëus, but for a devotee, no form of Kåñëa is important but the
original form, two-handed Çyämasundara. In the Brahmä-saàhitä it is stated that
those who are attached to the Çyämasundara form of Kåñëa in love and devotion
can see Him always within the heart and cannot see anything else. One should
understand, therefore, that the purport of this Eleventh Chapter is that the
form of Kåñëa is essential and supreme.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Eleventh Chapter of the
Çrémad-Bhagavad-gétä in the matter of the Universal Form.



CHAPTER TWELVE

Devotional Service

TEXT 1

TRANSLATION
Arjuna inquired: Which is considered to be more perfect: those who are properly
engaged in Your devotional service, or those who worship the impersonal Brahman,
the unmanifested?

PURPORT
Kåñëa has now explained about the personal, the impersonal and the universal and
has described all kinds of devotees and yogés. Generally, the transcendentalists
can be divided into two classes. One is the impersonalist, and the other is the
personalist. The personalist devotee engages himself with all energy in the
service of the Supreme Lord. The impersonalist engages himself not directly in
the service of Kåñëa but in meditation on the impersonal Brahman, the
unmanifested.

We find in this chapter that of the different processes for realization of the
Absolute Truth, bhakti-yoga, devotional service, is the highest. If one at all
desires to have the association of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, then he
must take to devotional service.

Those who worship the Supreme Lord directly by devotional service are called
personalists. Those who engage themselves in meditation on the impersonal
Brahman are called impersonalists. Arjuna is here questioning which position is
better. There are different ways to realize the Absolute Truth, but Kåñëa
indicates in this chapter that bhakti-yoga, or devotional service to Him, is
highest of all. It is the most direct, and it is the easiest means for
association with the Godhead.

In the Second Chapter the Lord explains that a living entity is not the material
body but is a spiritual spark, a part of the Absolute Truth. In the Seventh
Chapter He speaks of the living entity as part and parcel of the supreme whole
and recommends that he transfer his attention fully to the whole. In the Eighth
Chapter it is stated that whoever thinks of Kåñëa at the moment of death is at
once transferred to the spiritual sky, Kåñëa’s abode. And at the end of the
Sixth Chapter the Lord says that out of all the yogés, he who thinks of Kåñëa
within himself is considered to be the most perfect. So throughout the Gétä
personal devotion to Kåñëa is recommended as the highest form of spiritual
realization. Yet there are those who are still attracted to Kåñëa’s impersonal
brahmajyoti effulgence, which is the all-pervasive aspect of the Absolute Truth
and which is unmanifest and beyond the reach of the senses. Arjuna would like to
know which of these two types of transcendentalists is more perfect in
knowledge. In other words, he is clarifying his own position because he is
attached to the personal form of Kåñëa. He is not attached to the impersonal
Brahman. He wants to know whether his position is secure. The impersonal
manifestation, either in this material world or in the spiritual world of the
Supreme Lord, is a problem for meditation. Actually, one cannot perfectly
conceive of the impersonal feature of the Absolute Truth. Therefore Arjuna wants
to say, “What is the use of such a waste of time?” Arjuna experienced in the
Eleventh Chapter that to be attached to the personal form of Kåñëa is best
because he could thus understand all other forms at the same time and there was
no disturbance to his love for Kåñëa. This important question asked of Kåñëa by
Arjuna will clarify the distinction between the impersonal and personal
conceptions of the Absolute Truth.

TRANSLATION
The Blessed Lord said: He whose mind is fixed on My personal form, always
engaged in worshiping Me with great and transcendental faith, is considered by
Me to be most perfect.

PURPORT
In answer to Arjuna’s question, Kåñëa clearly says that he who concentrates upon
His personal form and who worships Him with faith and devotion is to be
considered most perfect in yoga. For one in such Kåñëa consciousness there are
no material activities because everything is done by Kåñëa. A pure devotee is
constantly engaged—sometimes he chants, sometimes he hears or reads books about
Kåñëa, or sometimes he cooks prasädam or goes to the marketplace to purchase
something for Kåñëa, or sometimes he washes the temple or the dishes—whatever he
does, he does not let a single moment pass without devoting his activities to
Kåñëa Such action is in full samädhi.

TRANSLATION
But those who fully worship the unmanifested, that which lies beyond the
perception of the senses, the all-pervading, inconceivable, fixed, and
immovable—the impersonal conception of the Absolute Truth—by controlling the
various senses and being equally disposed to everyone, such persons, engaged in
the welfare of all, at last achieve Me.

PURPORT
Those who do not directly worship the Supreme Godhead, Kåñëa, but who attempt to
achieve the same goal by an indirect process, also ultimately achieve the
supreme goal, Çré Kåñëa, as is stated, “After many births the man of wisdom
seeks refuge in Me, knowing Väsudeva is all.” When a person comes to full
knowledge after many births, he surrenders unto Lord Kåñëa. If one approaches
the Godhead by the method mentioned in this verse, he has to control the senses,
render service to everyone and engage in the welfare of all beings. It is
inferred that one has to approach Lord Kåñëa, otherwise there is no perfect
realization. Often there is much penance involved before one fully surrenders
unto Him.

In order to perceive the Supersoul within the individual soul, one has to cease
the sensual activities of seeing, hearing, tasting, working, etc. Then one comes
to understand that the Supreme Soul is present everywhere. Realizing this, one
envies no living entity—he sees no difference between man and animal because he
sees soul only, not the outer covering. But for the common man, this method of
impersonal realization is very difficult.

TRANSLATION
For those whose minds are attached to the unmanifested, impersonal feature of
the Supreme, advancement is very troublesome. To make progrese in that
discipline is always difficult for those who are embodied.

PURPORT
The group of transcendentalists who follow the path of the inconceivable,
unmanifested, impersonal feature of the Supreme Lord are called jïäna-yogés, and
persons who are in full Kåñëa consciousness, engaged in devotional service to
the Lord, are called bhakti-yogés. Now, here the difference between jïäna-yoga
and bhakti-yoga is definitely expressed. The process of jïäna-yoga, although
ultimately bringing one to the same goal, is very troublesome, whereas the path
of bhakti-yoga, the process of being in direct service to the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, is easier and is natural for the embodied soul. The
individual soul is embodied since time immemorial. It is very difficult for him
to simply theoretically understand that he is not the body. Therefore, the
bhakti-yogé accepts the Deity of Kåñëa as worshipable because there is some
bodily conception fixed in the mind, which can thus be applied. Of course,
worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His form within the temple is
not idol worship. There is evidence in the Vedic literature that worship may be
saguëa and nirguëa—of the Supreme possessing or not possessing attributes.
Worship of the Deity in the temple is saguëa worship, for the Lord is
represented by material qualities. But the form of the Lord, though represented
by material qualities such as stone, wood, or oil paint, is not actually
material. That is the absolute nature of the Supreme Lord.

A crude example may be given here. We may find some mailboxes on the street, and
if we post our letters in those boxes, they will naturally go to their
destination without difficulty. But any old box, or an imitation, which we may
find somewhere, which is not authorized by the post office, will not do the
work. Similarly, God has an authorized representation in the Deity form, which
is called arca-vigraha. This arca-vigraha is an incarnation of the Supreme Lord.
God will accept service through that form. The Lord is omnipotent and
all-powerful; therefore, by His incarnation as arca-vigraha, He can accept the
services of the devotee, just to make it convenient for the man in conditioned
life.

So, for a devotee, there is no difficulty in approaching the Supreme immediately
and directly, but for those who are following the impersonal way to spiritual
realization, the path is difficult. They have to understand the unmanifested
representation of the Supreme through such Vedic literatures as the Upaniñads,
and they have to learn the language, understand the nonperceptual feelings, and
they have to realize all these processes. This is not very easy for a common
man. A person in Kåñëa consciousness, engaged in devotional service, simply by
the guidance of the bona fide spiritual master, simply by offering regulative
obeisances unto the Deity, simply by hearing the glories of the Lord, and simply
by eating the remnants of foodstuffs offered to the Lord, realizes the Supreme
Personality of Godhead very easily. There is no doubt that the impersonalists
are unnecessarily taking a troublesome path with the risk of not realizing the
Absolute Truth at the ultimate end. But the personalist, without any risk,
trouble, or difficulty, approaches the Supreme Personality directly. A similar
passage appears in Çrémad-Bhägavatam. It is stated there that if one has to
ultimately surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead (This surrendering
process is called bhakti.), but instead takes the trouble to understand what is
Brahman and what is not Brahman and spends his whole life in that way, the
result is simply troublesome. Therefore it is advised here that one should not
take up this troublesome path of self-realization because there is uncertainty
in the ultimate result.

A living entity is eternally an individual soul, and if he wants to merge into
the spiritual whole, he may accomplish the realization of the eternal and
knowledgeable aspects of his original nature, but the blissful portion is not
realized. By the grace of some devotee, such a transcendentalist, highly learned
in the process of jïäna-yoga, may come to the point of bhakti-yoga, or
devotional service. At that time, long practice in impersonalism also becomes a
source of trouble, because he cannot give up the idea. Therefore an embodied
soul is always in difficulty with the unmanifest, both at the time of practice
and at the time of realization. Every living soul is partially independant, and
one should know for certain that this unmanifested realization is against the
nature of his spiritual blissful self. One should not take up this process. For
every individual living entity the process of Kåñëa consciousness, which entails
full engagement in devotional service, is the best way. If one wants to ignore
this devotional service, there is the danger of turning to atheism. Thus this
process of centering attention on the unmanifested, the inconceivable, which is
beyond the approach of the senses, as already expressed in this verse, should
never be encouraged at any time, especially in this age. It is not advised by
Lord Kåñëa.

PURPORT
It is explicitly stated here that the devotees are very fortunate to be
delivered very soon from material existence by the Lord. In pure devotional
service one comes to the realization that God is great and that the individual
soul is subordinate to Him. His duty is to render service to the Lord—if not,
then he will render service to mäyä.

As stated before, the Supreme Lord can only be appreciated by devotional
service. Therefore, one should be fully devoted. One should fix his mind fully
on Kåñëa in order to achieve Him. One should work only for Kåñëa. It does not
matter in what kind of work one engages, but that work should be done only for
Kåñëa. That is the standard of devotional service. The devotee does not desire
any achievement other than pleasing the Supreme Personality of Godhead. His
life’s mission is to please Kåñëa, and he can sacrifice everything for Kåñëa’s
satisfaction, just as Arjuna did in the Battle of Kurukñetra. The process is
very simple: one can devote himself in his occupation and engage at the same
time in chanting Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare
Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare. Such transcendental chanting attracts the devotee to
the Personality of Godhead.

The Supreme Lord herein promises that He will without delay deliver a pure
devotee thus engaged from the ocean of material existence. Those who are
advanced in yoga practice can willfully transfer the soul to whatever planet
they like by the yoga process, and others take the opportunity in various ways,
but as far as the devotee is concerned, it is clearly stated here that the Lord
Himself takes him. He does not need to wait to become very experienced in order
to transfer himself to the spiritual sky.

In the Varäha Puräëa this verse appears:

nayämi paramaà sthänam arcirädi-gatià vinä
garuòa-skandham äropya yatheccham aniväritaù

The purport of this verse is that a devotee does not need to practice
añöäìga-yoga in order to transfer his soul to the spiritual planets. The
responsibility is taken by the Supreme Lord Himself. He clearly states here that
He Himself becomes the deliverer. A child is completely cared for by his
parents, and thus his position is secure. Similarly, a devotee does not need to
endeavor to transfer himself by yoga practice to other planets. Rather, the
Supreme Lord, by His great mercy, comes at once, riding on His bird carrier
Garuòa, and at once delivers the devotee from this material existence. Although
a man who has fallen in the ocean may struggle very hard and may be very expert
in swimming, he cannot save himself. But if someone comes and picks him up from
the water, then he is easily rescued. Similarly, the Lord picks up the devotee
from this material existence. One simply has to practice the easy process of
Kåñëa consciousness and fully engage himself in devotional service. Any
intelligent man should always prefer the process of devotional service to all
other paths. In the Näräyaëéya this is confirmed as follows:

yä vai sädhana-sampatti-puruñärtha-catuñöaye
tayä vinä tad-äpnoti naro näräyaëäçrayaù

The purport of this verse is that one should not engage in the different
processes of fruitive activity or cultivate knowledge by the mental speculative
process. One who is devoted to the Supreme Personality can attain all the
benefits derived from other yogic processes, speculation, rituals, sacrifices,
charities, etc. That is the specific benediction of devotional service.

Simply by chanting the holy name of Kåñëa—Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa,
Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare—a devotee of the Lord can
approach the supreme destination easily and happily, but this destination cannot
be approached by any other process of religion.

The conclusion of Bhagavad-gétä is stated in the Eighteenth Chapter:

sarva-dharmän parityajya mäm ekaà çaraëaà vraja
ahaà tväà sarva-päpebhyo mokñayiñyämi mä çucaù.

One should give up all other processes of self-realization and simply execute
devotional service in Kåñëa consciousness. That will enable one to reach the
highest perfection of life. There is no need for one to consider the sinful
actions of his past life because the Supreme Lord fully takes charge of him.
Therefore one should not futilely try to deliver himself in spiritual
realization. Let everyone take shelter of the supreme omnipotent Godhead Kåñëa.
That is the highest perfection of life.

TRANSLATION
Just fix your mind upon Me, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and engage all

PURPORT
One who is engaged in Lord Kåñëa’s devotional service lives in a direct
relationship with the Supreme Lord, so there is no doubt that his position is
transcendental from the very beginning. A devotee does not live on the material
plane—he lives in Kåñëa. The holy name of the Lord and the Lord are
nondifferent; therefore when a devotee chants Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa and His internal
potency are dancing on the tongue of the devotee. When he offers Kåñëa food,
Kåñëa directly accepts these eatables, and the devotee becomes Kåñëa-ized by
eating the remnants. One who does not engage in such service cannot understand
how this is so, although this is a process recommended in the Gétä and in other
Vedic literatures.

TRANSLATION
My dear Arjuna, O winner of wealth, if you cannot fix your mind upon Me without
deviation, then follow the regulated principles of bhakti-yoga In this way you
will develop a desire to attain to Me.

PURPORT
In this verse, two different processes of bhakti-yoga are indicated. The first
applies to one who has actually developed an attachment for Kåñëa, the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, by transcendental love. And the other is for one who has
not developed an attachment for the Supreme Person by transcendental love. For
this second class there are different prescribed rules and regulations, which
one can follow to be ultimately elevated to the stage of attachment to Kåñëa.

Bhakti-yoga is the purification of the senses. At the present moment in material
existence the senses are always impure, being engaged in sense gratification.
But, by the practice of bhakti-yoga these senses can become purified, and in the
purified state they come directly in contact with the Supreme Lord. In this
material existence, I may be engaged in some service to some master, but I don’t
really lovingly serve my master. I simply serve to get some money. And the
master also is not in love; he takes service from me and pays me. So there is no
question of love. But for spiritual life, one must be elevated to the pure stage
of love. That stage of love can be achieved by practice of devotional service,
performed with the present senses.

This love of God is now in a dormant state in everyone’s heart. And, there, love
of God is manifested in different ways, but it is contaminated by the material
association. Now the material association has to be purified, and that dormant,
natural love for Kåñëa has to be revived. That is the whole process.

To practice the regulative principles of bhakti-yoga one should, under the
guidance of an expert spiritual master, follow certain principles: one should
rise early in the morning, take bath, enter the temple and offer prayers and
chant Hare Kåñëa, then collect flowers to offer to the Deity, cook foodstuffs to
offer to the Deity, take prasädam, and so on. There are various rules and
regulations which one should follow. And one should constantly hear
Bhagavad-gétä and Çrémad-Bhägavatam from pure devotees. This practice can help
anyone to rise to the level of love of God, and then he is sure of his progress
into the spiritual kingdom of God. This practice of bhakti-yoga, under the rules
and regulations, with the direction of a spiritual master, will surely bring one
to the stage of love of God.

TRANSLATION
If you cannot practice the regulations of bhakti-yoga, then just try to work for
Me, because by working for Me you will come to the perfect stage.

PURPORT
One who is not able even to practice the regulative principles of bhakti-yoga,
under the guidance of a spiritual master, can still be drawn to this
perfectional stage by working for the Supreme Lord. How to do this work has
already been explained in the fifty-fifth verse of the Eleventh Chapter. One
should be sympathetic to the propagation of Kåñëa consciousness. There are many
devotees who are engaged in the propagation of Kåñëa consciousness, and they
require help. So, even if one cannot directly practice the regulated principles
of bhakti-yoga, he can try to help such work. Every endeavor requires land,
capital, organization, and labor. Just as, in business, one requires a place to
stay, some capital to use, some labor, and some organization to expand, so the
same is required in the service of Kåñëa. The only difference is that in
materialism one works for sense gratification. The same work, however, can be
performed for the satisfaction of Kåñëa, and that is spiritual activity. If one
has sufficient money, he can help in building an office or temple for
propagating Kåñëa consciousness. Or he can help with publications. There are
various fields of activity, and one should be interested in such activities. If
one cannot sacrifice the result of such activities, the same person can still
sacrifice some percentage to propagate Kåñëa consciousness. This voluntary
service to the cause of Kåñëa consciousness will help one to rise to a higher
state of love for God, whereupon one becomes perfect.

TRANSLATION
If, however, you are unable to work in this consciousness, then try to act
giving up all results of your work and try to be self-situated.

PURPORT
It may be that one is unable to even sympathize with the activities of Kåñëa
consciousness because of social, familial or religious considerations or because
of some other impediments. If one attaches himself directly to the activities of
Kåñëa consciousness, there may be objection from family members, or so many
other difficulties. For one who has such a problem, it is advised that he
sacrifice the accumulated result of his activities to some good cause. Such
procedures are described in the Vedic rules. There are many descriptions of
sacrifices and special functions of the pumundi or special work in which the
result of one’s previous action may be applied. Thus one may gradually become
elevated to the state of knowledge. It is also found that when one who is not
even interested in the activities of Kåñëa consciousness gives charity to some
hospital or some other social institution, he gives up the hard-earned results
of his activities. That is also recommended here because by the practice of
giving up the fruits of one’s activities one is sure to purify his mind
gradually, and in that purified stage of mind one becomes able to understand
Kåñëa consciousness. Of course Kåñëa consciousness is not dependant on any other
experience because Kåñëa consciousness itself can purify one’s mind, but if
there are impediments to Kåñëa consciousness, one may try to give up the result
of his action. In that respect, social service, community service, national
service, sacrifice for one’s country, etc., may be accepted so that some day one
may come to the stage of pure devotional service to the Supreme Lord. In
Bhagavad-gétä we find it is stated: yataù pravåttir bhütänäm: If one decides to
sacrifice for the supreme cause, even if he does not know that the supreme cause
is Kåñëa, he will come gradually to understand that Kåñëa is the supreme cause
by the sacrificial method.

TRANSLATION
If you cannot take to this practice, then engage yourself in the cultivation of
knowledge. Better than knowledge, however, is meditation, and better than
meditation is renunciation of the fruits of action, for by such renunciation one
can attain peace of mind.

PURPORT
As mentioned in the previous verses, there are two kinds of devotional service:
the way of regulated principles, and the way of full attachment in love to the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. For those who are actually not able to follow
the principles of Kåñëa consciousness, it is better to cultivate knowledge
because by knowledge one can be able to understand his real position. Gradually
knowledge will develop to the point of meditation. By meditation one can be able
to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead by a gradual process. There are
processes which make one understand that one himself is the Supreme, and that
sort of meditation is preferred if one is unable to engage in devotional
service. If one is not able to meditate in such a way, then there are prescribed
duties, as enjoined in the Vedic literature, for the brähmaëas, vaiçyas, and
çüdras, which we shall find in a later chapter of Bhagavad-gétä. But in all
cases, one should give up the result or fruits of labor; this means to employ
the result of karma for some good cause. In summary, to reach the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, the highest goal, there are two processes: one process
is by gradual development, and the other process is direct. Devotional service
in Kåñëa consciousness is the direct method, and the other method involves
renouncing the fruits of one’s activities. Then one can come to the stage of
knowledge, then to the stage of meditation, then to the stage of understanding
the Supersoul, and then to the stage of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One
may either take the step by step process or the direct path. The direct process
is not possible for everyone; therefore the indirect process is also good. It
is, however, to be understood that the indirect process is not recommended for
Arjuna because he is already at the stage of loving devotional service to the
Supreme Lord. It is for others who are not at this state; for them the gradual
process of renunciation, knowledge, meditation and realization of the Supersoul
and Brahman should be followed. But as far as Bhagavad-gétä is concerned, it is
the direct method that is stressed. Everyone is advised to take to the direct
method and surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa.

TRANSLATION
One who is not envious but who is a kind friend to all living entities, who does
not think himself a proprietor, who is free from false ego and equal both in
happiness and distress, who is always satisfied and engaged in devotional
service with determination and whose mind and intelligence are in agreement with
Me—he is very dear to Me.

PURPORT
Coming again to the point of pure devotional service, the Lord is describing the
transcendental qualifications of a pure devotee in these two verses. A pure
devotee is never disturbed in any circumstances. Nor is he envious of anyone.
Nor does a devotee become his enemy’s enemy; he thinks that one is acting as his
enemy due to his own past misdeeds. Thus it is better to suffer than to protest.
In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam it is stated: tat te ’nukampäà su-samékñyamaëo.
Whenever a devotee is in distress or has fallen into difficulty, he thinks that
it is the Lord’s mercy upon him. He thinks: “Thanks to my past misdeeds I should
suffer far, far greater than I am suffering now. So it is by the mercy of the
Supreme Lord that I am not getting all the punishment I am due. I am just
getting a little, by the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.” Therefore
he is always calm, quiet and patient, despite many distressful conditions. A
devotee is also always kind to everyone, even to his enemy. Nirmama means that a
devotee does not attach much importance to the peace and trouble pertaining to
the body because he knows perfectly well that he is not the material body. He
does not identify with the body; therefore he is freed from the conception of
false ego and is equiposed both in happiness and distress. He is tolerant, and
he is satisfied with whatever comes by the grace of the Supreme Lord. He does
not endeavor much to achieve something with great difficulty; therefore he is
always joyful. He is a completely perfect mystic because he is fixed in the
instructions received from the spiritual master, and because his senses are
controlled, he is determined. He is not swayed by false argument because no one
can lead him from the fixed determination of devotional service. He is fully
conscious that Kåñëa is the eternal Lord, so no one can disturb him. All his
qualifications enable him to depend entirely on the Supreme Lord. Such a
standard of devotional service is undoubtably very rare, but a devotee becomes
situated in that stage by following the regulative principles of devotional
service. Furthermore, the Lord says that such a devotee is very dear to Him, for
the Lord is always pleased with all his activities in full Kåñëa consciousness.

TRANSLATION
He for whom no one is put into difficulty and who is not dirturbed by anxiety,
who is steady in happiness and distress, is very dear to Me.

PURPORT
A few of a devotee’s qualifications are further being described. No one is put
into difficulty, anxiety, fearfulness, or dissatisfaction by such a devotee.
Since a devotee is kind to everyone, he does not act in such a way to put others
into anxiety. At the same time, if others try to put a devotee into anxiety, he
is not disturbed. It is by the grace of the Lord that he is so practiced that he
is not disturbed by any outward disturbance. Actually because a devotee is
always engrossed in Kåñëa consciousness and engaged in devotional service, all
such material circumstances cannot woo him. Generally a materialistic person
becomes very happy when there is something for his sense gratification and his
body, but when he sees that others have something for their sense gratification
and he hasn’t, he is sorry and envious. When he is expecting some retaliation
from an enemy, he is in a state of fear, and when he cannot successfully execute
something he becomes dejected. But a devotee is always transcendental to all
these disturbances; therefore he is very dear to Kåñëa.

TRANSLATION
A devotee who is not dependant on the ordinary course of activities, who is
pure, expert, without cares, free from all pains, and who does not strive for
some result, is very dear to Me.

PURPORT
Money may be offered to a devotee, but he should not struggle to acquire it. If
automatically, by the grace of the Supreme, money comes to him, he is not
agétäted. Naturally a devotee takes bath at least twice in a day and rises early
in the morning for devotional service. Thus he is naturally clean both inwardly
and outwardly. A devotee is always expert because he fully knows the sense of
all activities of life, and he is convinced of the authoritative scriptures. A
devotee never takes the part of a particular party; therefore he is carefree. He
is never pained because he is free from all designations; he knows that his body
is a designation, so if there are some bodily pains, he is free. The pure
devotee does not endeavor for anything which is against the principles of
devotional service. For example, constructing a big building requires great
energy, and a devotee does not take to such business if it does not benefit him
by advancing his devotional service. He may construct a temple for the Lord, and
for that he may take all kinds of anxiety, but he does not construct a big house
for his personal relations.

One who neither grasps pleasure or grief, who neither laments nor desires, and

PURPORT
A pure devotee is neither happy nor distressed over material gain and loss, nor
is he very much anxious to get a son or disciple, nor is he distressed by not
getting them. If he loses anything which is very dear to him, he does not
lament. Similarly, if he does not get what he desires, he is not distressed. He
is transcendental in the face of all kinds of auspicious, inauspicious and
sinful activities. He is prepared to accept all kinds of risks for the
satisfaction of the Supreme Lord. Nothing is an impediment in the discharge of
his devotional service. Such a devotee is very dear to Kåñëa.

One who is equal to friends and enemies, who is equiposed in honor and dishonor,
heat and cold, happiness and distress, fame and infamy, who is always free from
contamination, always silent and satisfied with anything, who doesn’t care for
any residence, who is fixed in knowledge and engaged in devotional service, is
very dear to Me.

PURPORT
A devotee is always free from all bad association. Sometimes one is praised and
sometimes one is defamed; that is the nature of human society. But a devotee is
always transcendental to artificial fame and infamy, distress or happiness. He
is very patient. He does not speak of anything but the topics about Kåñëa;
therefore he is called silent. Silent does not mean that one should not speak;
silent means that one should not speak nonsense. One should speak only of
essentials, and the most essential speech for the devotee is to speak of the
Supreme Lord. He is happy in all conditions; sometimes he may get very palatable
foodstuffs, sometimes not, but he is satisfied. Nor does he care for any
residential facility. He may sometimes live underneath a tree, and he may
sometimes live in a very palatial building; he is attracted to neither. He is
called fixed because he is fixed in his determination and knowledge. We may find
some repetition in the descriptions of the qualifications of a devotee, but this
is just to give an illustration of the fact that a devotee must acquire all
these qualifications. Without good qualifications, one cannot be a pure devotee.
One who is not a devotee has no good qualification. One who wants to be
recognized as a devotee should develop the good qualifications. Of course he
does not extraneously endeavor to acquire these qualifications, but engagement
in Kåñëa consciousness and devotional service automatically helps him develop
them.

He who follows this imperishable path of devotional service and who completely

PURPORT
In this chapter the religion of eternal engagement, the explanation of the
process of transcendental service for approaching the Supreme Lord, is given.
This process is very dear to the Lord, and He accepts a person who is engaged in
such a process. The question who is better—one who is engaged in the path of
impersonal Brahman or one who is engaged in the personal service of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead—was raised by Arjuna, and the Lord replied to him so
explicitly that there is no doubt that devotional service to the Personality of
Godhead is the best of all processes of spiritual realization. In other words,
in this chapter it is decided that through good association, one develops
attachment for pure devotional service and thereby accepts a bona fide spiritual
master and from him begins to hear and chant and observe the regulative
principles of devotional service with faith, attachment and devotion and thus
becomes engaged in the transcendental service of the Lord. This path is
recommended in this chapter; therefore there is no doubt that devotional service
is the only absolute path for self-realization, for the attainment of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. The impersonal conception of the Supreme
Absolute Truth, as described in this chapter, is recommended only up to the time
one surrenders himself for self-realization. In other words, as long as one does
not have the chance to associate with a pure devotee, the impersonal conception
may be beneficial. In the impersonal conception of the Absolute Truth one works
without fruitive result, meditates and cultivates knowledge to understand spirit
and matter. This is necessary as long as one is not in the association of a pure
devotee. Fortunately, if one develops directly a desire to engage in Kåñëa
consciousness in pure devotional service, he does not need to undergo step by
step improvements in spiritual realization. Devotional service, as described in
the middle six chapters of Bhagavad-gétä, is more congenial. One need not bother
about materials to keep body and soul together because by the grace of the Lord
everything is carried out automatically.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Twelfth Chapter of the
Çrémad-Bhagavad-gétä in the matter of Devotional Service.

TRANSLATION
Arjuna said: O my dear Kåñëa, I wish to know about prakåti [nature], Puruña [the
enjoyer], and the field and the knower of the field, and of knowledge and the
end of knowledge. The Blessed Lord then said: This body, O son of Kunté, is
called the field, and one who knows this body is called the knower of the field.

PURPORT
Arjuna was inquisitive about prakåti or nature, puruña, the enjoyer, kñetra, the
field, kñetrajïa, its knower, and of knowledge and the object of knowledge. When
he inquired about all these, Kåñëa said that this body is called the field and
that one who knows this body is called the knower of the field. This body is the
field of activity for the conditioned soul. The conditioned soul is entrapped in
material existence, and he attempts to lord over material nature. And so,
according to his capacity to dominate material nature, he gets a field of
activity. That field of activity is the body. And what is the body? The body is
made of senses. The conditioned soul wants to enjoy sense gratification, and,
according to his capacity to enjoy sense gratification, he is offered a body, or
field of activity. Therefore the body is called kñetra, or the field of activity
for the conditioned soul. Now, the person who does not identify himself with the
body is called kñetrajïa, the knower of the field. It is not very difficult to
understand the difference between the field and its knower, the body and the
knower of the body. Any person can consider that from childhood to old age he
undergoes so many changes of body and yet is still one person, remaining. Thus
there is a difference between the knower of the field of activities and the
actual field of activities. A living conditioned soul can thus understand that
he is different from the body. It is described in the beginning—dehe ’smin—that
the living entity is within the body and that the body is changing from
childhood to boyhood and from boyhood to youth and from youth to old age, and
the person who owns the body knows that the body is changing. The owner is
distinctly kñetrajïa. Sometimes we understand that I am happy, I am mad, I am a
woman, I am a dog, I am a cat: these are the knowers. The knower is different
from the field. Although we use many articles—our clothes, etc.—we know- that we
are different from the things used. Similarly, we also understand by a little
contemplation that we are different from the body.

In the first six chapters of Bhagavad-gétä, the knower of the body, the living
entity, and the position by which he can understand the Supreme Lord are
described. In the middle six chapters of the Gétä, the Supreme Personality of
Godhead and the relationship between the individual soul and the Supersoul in
regard to devotional service are described. The superior position of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead and the subordinate position of the individual soul are
definitely defined in these chapters. The living entities are subordinate under
all circumstances, but in their forgetfulness they are suffering. When
enlightened by pious activities, they approach the Supreme Lord in different
capacities—as the distressed, those in want of money, the inquisitive, and those
in search of knowledge. That is also described. Now, starting with the
Thirteenth Chapter, how the living entity comes into contact with material
nature, how he is delivered by the Supreme Lord through the different methods of
fruitive activities, cultivation of knowledge, and the discharge of devotional
service are explained. Although the living entity is completely different from
the material body, he somehow becomes related. This also is explained.

TRANSLATION
O scion of Bharata, you should understand that I am also the knower in all
bodies, and to understand this body and its owner is called knowledge. That is
My opinion.

PURPORT
While discussing the subject of this body and the owner of the body, the soul
and the Supersoul, we shall find three different topics of study: the Lord, the
1iving entity, and matter. In every field of activities, in every body, there
are two souls: the individual soul and the Supersoul. Because the Supersoul is
the plenary expansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, Kåñëa says,
“I am also the knower, but I am not the individual owner of the body. I am the
superknower. I am present in every body as the Paramätmä, or Supersoul.”

One who studies the subject matter of the field of activity and the knower of
the field very minutely, in terms of this Bhagavad-gétä, can attain to
knowledge.

The Lord says: “I am the knower of the field of activities in every individual
body.” The individual may be the knower of his own body, but he is not in
knowledge of other bodies. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is present as
the Supersoul in all bodies, knows everything about all bodies. He knows all the
different bodies of all the various species of life. A citizen may know
everything about his patch of land, but the king knows not only his palace but
all the properties possessed by the individual citizens. Similarly, one may be
the proprietor of the body individually, but the Supreme Lord is the proprietor
of all bodies. The king is the original proprietor of the kingdom, and the
citizen is the secondary proprietor. Similarly, the Supreme Lord is the supreme
proprietor of all bodies.

The body consists of the senses. The Supreme Lord is Håñékeça, which means
controller of the senses. He is the original controller of the senses, just as
the king is the original controller of all the activities of the state, and the
citizens are secondary controllers. The Lord also says: “I am also the knower.”
This means that He is the superknower; the individual soul knows only his
particular body. In the Vedic literature, it is stated as follows:

kñeträëi hi çaréräëi béjaà cäpi çubhäçubhe
täni vetti sa yogätmä tataù kñetrajïa ucyate.

This body is called the kñetra, and within it dwells the owner of the body and
the Supreme Lord who knows both the body and the owner of the body. Therefore He
is called the knower of all fields. The distinction between the field of
activities, the owner of activities and the supreme owner of activities is
described as follows. Perfect knowledge of the constitution of the body, the
constitution of the individual soul, and the constitution of the Supersoul is
known in terms of Vedic literature as jïänam. That is the opinion of Kåñëa. To
understand both the soul and the Supersoul as one yet distinct is knowledge. One
who does not understand the field of activity and the knower of activity is not
in perfect knowledge. One has to understand the position of prakåti, nature, and
puruña, the enjoyer of the nature, and éçvara, the knower who dominates or
controls nature and the individual soul. One should not confuse the three in
their different capacities. One should not confuse the painter, the painting and
the easel. This material world, which is the field of activities, is nature, and
the enjoyer of nature is the living entity, and above them both is the supreme
controller, the Personality of Godhead. It is stated in the Vedic language:
“bhoktä bhogyaà preritäraà ca matvä sarvaà proktaà tri-vidhaà brahmam etat.”
There are three Brahman conceptions: prakåti is Brahman as the field of
activities, and the jéva (individual soul) is also Brahman and is trying to
control material nature, and the controller of both of them is also Brahman, but
He is the factual controller.

In this chapter it will be also explained that out of the two knowers, one is
fallible and the other is infallible. One is superior and the other is
subordinate. One who understands the two knowers of the field to be one and the
same contradicts the Supreme Personality of Godhead who states here very clearly
that “I am also the knower of the field of activity.” One who misunderstands a
rope to be a serpent is not in knowledge. There are different kinds of bodies,
and there are different owners of the bodies. Because each individual soul has
his individual capacity of lording it over material nature, there are different
bodies. But the Supreme also is present in them as the controller. The word ca
is significant, for it indicates the total number of bodies. That is the opinion
of Çréla Baladeva Vidyäbhüñaëa: Kåñëa is the Supersoul present in each and every
body apart from the individual soul. And Kåñëa explicitly says here that the
Supersoul is the controller of both the field of activities and the finite
enjoyer.

TRANSLATION
Now please hear My brief description of this field of activity and how it is
constituted, what its changes are, whence it is produced, who that knower of the
field of activities is, and what his influences are.

PURPORT
The Lord is describing the field of activities and the knower of the field of
activities in their constitutional positions. One has to know how this body is
constituted, the materials of which this body is made, under whose control this
body is working, how the changes are taking place, wherefrom the changes are
coming, what the causes are, what the reasons are, what the ultimate goal of the
individual is, and what the actual form of the individual soul is. One should
also know the distinction between the individual living soul and the Supersoul,
the different influences, their potentials, etc. One just has to understand this
Bhagavad-gétä directly from the description given by the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, and all this will be clarified. But one should be careful not to
consider the Supreme Personality of Godhead in every body and individual soul to
be the jéva. This is something like equalizing the potent and the impotent.

TRANSLATION
That knowledge of the field of activities and of the knower of activities is
described by various sages in various Vedic writings—especially in the
Vedänta-sütra—and is presented with all reasoning as to cause and effect.

PURPORT
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, is the highest authority in
explaining this knowledge. Still, as a matter of course, learned scholars and
standard authorities always give evidence from previous authorities. Kåñëa is
explaining this most controversial point regarding the duality and non-duality
of the soul and the Supersoul by referring to Scriptures, the Vedänta, which are
accepted as authority. First, He says, this is according to different sages. As
far as the sages are concerned, besides Himself, Vyäsadeva, the author of the
Vedänta-sütra, is a great sage, and in the Vedänta-sütra duality is perfectly
explained. And Vyäsadeva’s father, Paräçara, was also a great sage, and he
writes in his books of religiosity: “aham tvaà ca athänye…” “We—you, I and
various other living entities—are all transcendental, although in material
bodies. Now we are fallen into the ways of the three modes of material nature
according to our different karma. As such, some are on higher levels, and some
are in the lower nature. The higher and lower natures exist due to ignorance and
are being manifested in an infinite number of living entities. But the
Supersoul, which is infallible, is uncontaminated by the three qualities of
nature and is transcendental.” Similarly, in the original Vedas, a distinction
between the soul, the Supersoul and the body is made, especially in the Kaöha
Upaniñad.

There is a manifestation of the Supreme Lord’s energy known as annamaya by which
one depends simply upon food for existence. This is a materialistic realization
of the Supreme. Then there is präëamaya; this means that after realizing the
Supreme Absolute Truth in foodstuff, one can realize the Absolute Truth in the
living symptoms, or life forms. In jïänamaya the living symptom develops to the
point of thinking, feeling, and willing. Then there is Brahman realization and
the realization called vijïänamaya by which the living entity’s mind and life
symptoms are distinguished from the living entity himself. The next and supreme
stage is änandamaya, realization of the all-blissful nature. Thus there are five
stages of Brahman realization, which is called brahma puccham. Out of these the
first three—annamaya, präëamaya, and jïänamaya—involve the fields of activities
of the living entities. Transcendental to all these fields of activities is the
Supreme Lord, who is called änandamaya. In the Vedänta-sütra also the Supreme is
called änandamayo ’bhyäsät. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is by nature full
of joy, and to enjoy His transcendental bliss, He expands into vijïänamaya,
präëamaya, jïänamaya, and annamaya. In this field of activities the living
entity is considered to be the enjoyer, and different from him is the
änandamaya. That means that if the living entity decides to enjoy, in
dovetailing himself with the änandamaya, then he becomes perfect. This is the
real picture of the Supreme Lord, as supreme knower of the field, the living
entity, as subordinate knower, and the nature of the field of activities.

The five great elements, false ego, intelligence, the unmanifested, the ten
senses, the mind, the five sense objects, desire, hatred, happiness, distress,
the aggregate, the life symptoms, and convictions—all these are considered, in
summary, to be the field of activities and its interactions.

PURPORT
From all the authoritative statements of the great sages, the Vedic hymns and
the aphorisms of the Vedänta-sütra, the components of this world are earth,
water, fire, air and ether. These are the five great elements (mahäbhüta). Then
there are false ego, intelligence and the unmanifested stage of the three modes
of nature. Then there are five senses for acquiring knowledge: the eyes, ears,
nose, tongue and touch. Then five working senses: voice, legs, hands, the anus
and the genitals. Then, above the senses, there is the mind, which is within and
which can be called the sense within. Therefore, including the mind, there are
eleven senses altogether. Then there are the five objects of the senses: smell,
taste, warmth, touch and sound. Now the aggregate of these twenty-four elements
is called the field of activity. If one makes an analytical study of these
twenty-four subjects, then he can very well understand the field of activity.
Then there is desire, hatred, pleasure and pain, which are interactions,
representations of the five great elements in the gross body. The living
symptoms, represented by consciousness and conviction, are the manifestation of
the subtle body—mind, ego and intelligence. These subtle elements are included
within the field of activities.

The five great elements are a gross representation of the subtle false ego. They
are a representation in the material conception. Consciousness is represented by
intelligence, of which the unmanifested stage is the three modes of material
nature. The unmanifested three modes of material nature is called pradhäna.

One who desires to know the twenty-four elements in detail along with their
interactions should study the philosophy in more detail. In Bhagavad-gétä, a
summary only is given.

The body is the representation of all these factors, and there are changes of
the body, which are six in number: the body is born, it grows, it stays, it
produces by-products, then begins to decay, and at the last stage it vanishes.
Therefore the field is a nonpermanent material thing. However, the kñetrajïa,
the knower of the field, its proprietor, is different.

Humility, pridelessness, nonviolence, tolerance, simplicity, approaching a bona
fide spiritual master, cleanliness, steadiness and self-control; renunciation of
the objects of sense gratification, absence of false ego, the perception of the
evil of birth, death, old age and disease; nonattachment to children, wife, home
and the rest, and evenmindedness amid pleasant and unpleasant events; constant
and unalloyed devotion to Me, resorting to solitary places, detachment from the
general mass of people; accepting the importance of self-realization, and
philosophical search for the Absolute Truth—all these I thus declare to be
knowledge, and what is contrary to these is ignorance.

PURPORT
This process of knowledge is sometimes misunderstood by less intelligent men as
being the interaction of the field of activity. But actually this is the real
process of knowledge. If one accepts this process, then the possibility of
approaching the Absolute Truth exists. This is not the interaction of the
tenfold elements, as described before, This is actually the means to get out of
it. Of all the descriptions of the process of knowledge, the most important
point is described in the first line of the tenth verse: The process of
knowledge terminates in unalloyed devotional service to the Lord. So, if one
does not approach, or is not able to approach, the transcendental service of the
Lord, then the other nineteen items are of no particular value. But, if one
takes to devotional service in full Kåñëa consciousness, the other nineteen
items automatically develop within him. The principle of accepting a spiritual
master, as mentioned in the seventh verse, is essential. Even for one who takes
to devotional service, it is most important. Transcendental life begins when one
accepts a bona fide spiritual master. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Çré
Kåñëa, clearly states here that this process of knowledge is the actual path.
Anything speculated beyond this is nonsense.

As for the knowledge outlined here, the items may be analyzed as follows:
Humility means that one should not be anxious to have the satisfaction of being
honored by others. The material conception of life makes us very eager to
receive honor from others, but from the point of view of a man in perfect
knowledge—who knows that he is not this body—anything, honor or dishonor,
pertaining to this body is useless. One should not be hankering after this
material deception. People are very anxious to be famous for their religion, and
consequently sometimes it is found that without understanding the principles of
religion, one enters into some group, which is not actually following religious
principles, and then wants to advertise himself as a religious mentor. As for
actual advancement in spiritual science, one should have a test to see how far
he is progressing. He can judge by these items.

Nonviolence is generally taken to mean not killing or destroying the body, but
actually nonviolence means not to put others into distress. People in general
are trapped by ignorance in the material concept of life, and they perpetually
suffer material pains. So, unless one elevates people to spiritual knowledge,
one is practicing violence. One should try his best to distribute real knowledge
to the people, so that they may become enlightened and leave this material
entanglement. That is nonviolence.

Tolerance means that one should be practiced to bear insult and dishonor from
others. If one is engaged in the advancement of spiritual knowledge, there will
be so many insults and much dishonor from others. This is expected because
material nature is so constituted. Even a boy like Prahläda, who, only five
years old, was engaged in the cultivation of spiritual knowledge, was endangered
when his father became antagonistic to his devotion. The father tried to kill
him in so many ways, but Prahlada tolerated him. So, for making advancement in
spiritual knowledge, there may be many impediments, but we should be tolerant
and continue our progress with determination.

Simplicity means that without diplomacy one should be so straightforward that he
can disclose the real truth even to an enemy. As for acceptance of the spiritual
master, that is essential, because without the instruction of a bona fide
spiritual master, one cannot progress in the spiritual science. One should
approach the spiritual master with all humility and offer him all services so
that he will be pleased to bestow his blessings upon the disciple. Because a
bona fide spiritual master is a representative of Kåñëa, if he bestows any
blessings upon his disciple, that will make the disciple immediately advanced
without the disciple’s following the regulated principles. Or, the regulated
principles will be easier for one who has served the spiritual master without
reservation.

Cleanliness is essential for making advancement in spiritual life. There are two
kinds of cleanliness: external and internal. External cleanliness means taking a
bath, but for internal cleanliness, one has to think of Kåñëa always and chant
Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/Hare Räma. Hare Räma, Räma Räma
Hare Hare. This process cleans the accumulated dust of past karma from the mind.

Steadiness means that one should be very determined to make progress in
spiritual life. Without such determination, one cannot make tangible progress.
And self-control means that one should not accept anything which is detrimental
to the path of spiritual progress. One should become accustomed to this and
reject anything which is against the path of spiritual progress. This is real
renunciation. The senses are so strong that they are always anxious to have
sense gratification. One should not cater to these demands, which are not
necessary. The senses should only be gratified to keep the body fit so that one
can discharge his duty in advancing in spiritual life. The most important and
uncontrollable sense is the tongue. If one can control the tongue, then there is
every possibility of controlling the other senses. The function of the tongue is
to taste and to vibrate. Therefore, by systematic regulation, the tongue should
always be engaged in tasting the remnants of foodstuffs offered to Kåñëa and
chanting Hare Kåñëa. As far as the eyes are concerned, they should not be
allowed to see anything but the beautiful form of Kåñëa. That will control the
eyes. Similarly, the ears should be engaged in hearing about Kåñëa and the nose
in smelling the flowers offered to Kåñëa. This is the process of devotional
service, and it is understood here that Bhagavad-gétä is simply expounding the
science of devotional service. Devotional service is the main and sole
objective. Unintelligent commentators on the Gétä try to divert the mind of the
reader to other subjects, but there is no other subject in Bhagavad-gétä but
devotional service.

False ego means accepting this body as oneself. When one understands that he is
not his body and is spirit soul, that is real ego. Ego is there. False ego is
condemned, but not real ego. In the Vedic literature, it is said: ahaà
brahmäsmi. I am Brahman, I am spirit. This “I am,” the sense of self, also
exists in the liberated stage of self-realization. This sense of “I am” is ego,
but when the sense of “I am” is applied to this false body, it is false ego.
When the sense of self is applied to reality, that is real ego. There are some
philosophers who say we should give up our ego, but we cannot give up our ego
because ego means identity. We ought, of course, to give up the false
identification with the body.

One should try to understand the distress of accepting birth, death, old age and
disease. There are descriptions in various Vedic literatures of birth. In the
Çrémad-Bhägavatam the world of the unborn, the child’s stay in the womb of the
mother, its suffering, etc., are all very graphically described. It should be
thoroughly understood that birth is distressful. Because we forget how much
distress we have suffered within the womb of the mother, we do not make any
solution to the repetition of birth and death. Similarly at the time of death,
there are all kinds of sufferings, and they are also mentioned in the
authoritative scriptures. These should be discussed. And as far as disease and
old age are concerned, everyone gets practical experience. No one wants to be
diseased, and no one wants to become old, but there is no avoiding these. Unless
we have a pessimistic view of this material life, considering the distresses of
birth, death, old age and disease, there is no impetus for our making
advancement in spiritual life.

As for detachment from children, wife and home, it is not meant that one should
have no feeling for these. They are natural objects of affection, but when they
are not favorable to spiritual progress, then one should not be attached to
them. The best process for making the home pleasant is Kåñëa consciousness. If
one is in full Kåñëa consciousness, he can make his home very happy because this
process of Kåñëa consciousness is very easy. One need only chant Hare Kåñëa,
Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare,
accept the remnants of foodstuffs offered to Kåñëa, have some discussion on
books like Bhagavad-gétä and Çrémad-Bhägavatam, and engage oneself in Deity
worship. These four will make one happy. One should train the members of his
family in this way. The family members can sit down morning and evening and
chant together Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/Hare Räma, Hare
Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare. If one can mold his family life in this way to
develop Kåñëa consciousness, following these four principles, then there is no
need to change from family life to renounced life. But if it is not congenial,
not favorable for spiritual advancement, then family life should be abandoned.
One must sacrifice everything to realize or serve Kåñëa, just as Arjuna did.
Arjuna did not want to kill his family members, but when he understood that
these family members were impediments to his Kåñëa realization, he accepted the
instruction of Kåñëa and fought and killed them. In all cases, one should be
detached from the happiness and distress of family life because in this world
one can never be fully happy or fully miserable. Happiness and distress are
concommitant factors of material life. One should learn to tolerate, as advised
in Bhagavad-gétä. One can never restrict the coming and going of happiness and
distress, so one should be detached from the materialistic way of life and be
automatically equiposed in both cases. Generally, when we get something
desirable, we are very happy, and when we get something undesirable, we are
distressed. But if we are actually in the spiritual position, these things will
not agitate us. To reach that stage, we have to practice unbreakable devotional
service; devotional service to Kåñëa without deviation means engaging oneself in
the nine processes of devotional service, chanting, hearing, worshiping,
offering respect, etc., as described in the last verse of the Ninth Chapter.
That process should be followed. Naturally, when one is adapted to the spiritual
way of life, he will not want to mix with materialistic men. That would go
against his grain. One may test himself by seeing how far he is inclined to live
in a solitary place without unwanted association.

Naturally a devotee has no taste for unnecessary sporting or cinema-going or
enjoying some social function, because he understands that these are simply a
waste of time. There are many research scholars and philosophers who study sex
life or some other subject, but according to Bhagavad-gétä, such research work
and philosophical speculation have no value. That is more or less nonsensical.
According to Bhagavad-gétä, one should make research by philosophical discretion
into the nature of the soul. One should make research to understand with what
the self is concerned. That is recommended here.

As far as self-realization is concerned, it is clearly stated here that
bhakti-yoga is especially practical. As soon as there is a question of devotion,
one must consider the relationship between the Supersoul and the individual
soul. The individual soul and the Supersoul cannot be one, at least not in the
bhakti conception, the devotional conception of life. This service of the
individual soul to the Supreme Soul is eternal, nityam, as is clearly stated. So
bhakti or devotional service is eternal. One should be established in that
philosophical conviction, otherwise it is only a waste of time, ignorance.

In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, this is explained; vadanti tat tattva-vidas tattvaà
yaj jïänam advayam. “Those who are actually knowers of the Absolute Truth know
that the Self is realized in three different phases as Brahman, Paramätmä and
Bhagavän.” (Bhäg. 1.2.11) Bhagavän is the last word in the realization of the
Absolute Truth; therefore one should reach up to that platform of understanding
the Supreme Personality of Godhead and thus engage in the devotional service of
the Lord. That is perfection of knowledge.

Beginning from practicing humility up to the point of realization of the Supreme
Truth, the Absolute Personality of Godhead, this process is just like a
staircase beginning from the ground floor up to the top floor. Now on this
staircase there are so many people who have reached the first floor, the second
or third floor, etc., but unless one reaches the top floor, which is the
understanding of Kåñëa, he is at a lower stage of knowledge. If anyone wants to
compete with God and at the same time make advancement in spiritual knowledge,
he will be frustrated. It is clearly stated that without humility understanding
is harmful. To think oneself God is most puffed up. Although the living entity
is always being kicked by the stringent laws of material nature, still he
thinks, “I am God” because of ignorance. One should be humble and know that he
is subordinate to the Supreme Lord. Due to rebellion against the Supreme Lord,
one becomes subordinate to material nature. One must know and be convinced of
this truth.

I shall now explain the knowable, knowing which you will taste the eternal. This

and it lies beyond the cause and effect of this material world.

PURPORT
The Lord has explained the field of activities and the knower of the field. He
has also explained the process of knowing the knower of the field of activities.
Now He is explaining the knowable, both the soul and the Supersoul respectively.
By knowledge of the knower, both the soul and the Supersoul, one can relish the
nectar of life. As explained in the Second Chapter, the living entity is
eternal. This is also confirmed here. There is no specific date at which the
jéva was born. Nor can anyone trace out the history of jévätmä’s manifestation
from the Supreme Lord. Therefore it is beginningless. The Vedic literature
confirms this: na jäyate måjayate vä vipaçcit. The knower of the body is never
born and never dies, and he is full of knowledge. The Supreme Lord is also
stated in the Vedic literature as pradhäna-kñetrajïa-patir guëeçaù. The Supreme
Lord as the Supersoul is the chief knower of the body, and He is the master of
the three modes of material nature. In the småti it is said: däsa-bhüto harer
eva nänyasvaiva kadäcana. The living entities are eternally in the service of
the Supreme Lord. This is also confirmed by Lord Caitanya in His teaching;
therefore the description of Brahman mentioned in this verse is in relation to
the individual soul, and when the word Brahman is applied to the living entity,
it is to be understood that he is vijïänaà brahma as opposed to ananta-brahma.
Ananta-brahma is the Supreme Brahman Personality of Godhead.

TRANSLATION
Everywhere are His hands and legs, His eyes and faces, and He hears everything.
In this way the Supersoul exists.

PURPORT
As the sun exists diffusing its unlimited rays, so does the Supersoul, or
Supreme Personality of Godhead. He exists in His all-pervading form, and in Him
exist all the individual living entities, beginning from the first great
teacher, Brahmä, down to the small ants. There are unlimited heads, legs, hands
and eyes, and unlimited living entities. All are existing in and on the
Supersoul. Therefore the Supersoul is all-pervading. The individual soul,
however, cannot say that he has his hands, legs and eyes everywhere. That is not
possible. If he thinks that although under ignorance he is not conscious that
his hands and legs are diffused all over, but when he attains to proper
knowledge he will come to that stage, his thinking is contradictory. This means
that the individual soul, having become conditioned by material nature, is not
supreme. The Supreme is different from the individual soul. The Supreme Lord can
extend His hand without limit; the individual soul cannot. In Bhagavad-gétä the
Lord says that if anyone offers Him a flower, or a fruit, or a little water, He
accepts. If the Lord is a far distance away, how can He accept things? This is
the omnipotence of the Lord: even though He is situated in His own abode, far,
far away from earth, He can extend His hand to accept what anyone offers. That
is His potency. In the Brahmä-saàhitä it is stated, goloka eva nivasati:
although He is always engaged in pastimes in His transcendental planet, He is
all-pervading. The individual soul cannot claim that he is all-pervading.
Therefore this verse describes the Supreme Soul, the Personality of Godhead, not
the individual soul.

TRANSLATION
The Supersoul is the original source of all senses, yet He is without senses. He
is unattached, although He is the maintainer of all living beings. He transcends
the modes of nature, and at the same time He is the master of all modes of
material nature.

PURPORT
The Supreme Lord, although the source of all the senses of the living entities,
doesn’t have material senses like they have. Actually, the individual souls have
spiritual senses, but in condemned life they are covered with the material
elements and therefore the sense activities are exhibited through matter. The
Supreme Lord’s senses are not so covered. His senses are transcendental and are
therefore called nirguëa. Guëa means the material modes, but His senses are
without material covering. It should be understood that His senses are not
exactly like ours. Although He is the source of all our sensual activities, He
has His transcendental senses which are uncontaminated. This is very nicely
explained in the Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad in the verse: sarvataù päëi-pädam. The
Supreme Personality of Godhead has no hands which are materially contaminated,
but He has His hands and accepts whatever sacrifice is offered to Him. That is
the distinction between the conditioned soul and the Supersoul. He has no
material eyes, but He has eyes—otherwise how could He see? He sees everything,
past, present and future. He lives within the heart of the living being, and He
knows what we have done in the past, what we are doing now, and what is awaiting
us in the future. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä: He knows everything,
but no one knows Him. It is said that the Supreme Lord has no legs like us, but
He can travel throughout space because He has spiritual legs. In other words,
the Lord is not impersonal; He has His eyes, legs, hands and everything else,
and because we are part and parcel of the Supreme Lord we also have these
things. But His hands, legs, eyes and senses are not contaminated by material
nature.

Bhagavad-gétä also confirms that when the Lord appears He appears as He is by
His internal potency. He is not contaminated by the material energy because He
is the Lord of material energy. In the Vedic literature we find that His whole
embodiment is spiritual. He has His eternal form called sac-cid-änanda-vigraha.
He is full of all opulence. He is the proprietor of all wealth and the owner of
all energy. He is the most intelligent and is full of knowledge. These are some
of the symptoms of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is maintainer of all
living entities and the witness of all activities. As far as we can understand
from Vedic literature, the Supreme Lord is always transcendental. Although we do
not see His head, face, hands, or legs, He has them, and when we are elevated to
the transcendental situation then we can see the Lord’s form. Due to materially
contaminated senses, we cannot see His form. Therefore the impersonalists who
are still materially affected cannot understand the Personality of Godhead.

TRANSLATION
The Supreme Truth exists both internally and externally, in the moving and

Although far, far away, He is also near to all.

PURPORT
In Vedic literature we understand that Näräyaëa, the Supreme Person, is residing
both outside and inside of every living entity. He is present both in the
spiritual and material world. Although He is far, far away, still He is near to
us. These are the statements of Vedic literature. Äséno düraà vrajati çayäno
yäti sarvataù. And, because He is always engaged in transcendental bliss, we
cannot understand how He is enjoying His full opulence. We cannot see or
understand with these material senses. Therefore in the Vedic language it is
said that to understand Him our material mind and senses cannot act. But one who
has purified his mind and senses by practicing Kåñëa consciousness in devotional
service can see Him constantly. It is confirmed in Brahmä-saàhitä that the
devotee who has developed love for the Supreme God can see Him always, without
cessation. And it is confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä (11.54) that He can be seen and
understood only by devotional service. Bhaktyä tvananyayä çakyaù.

TRANSLATION
Although the Supersoul appears to be divided, He is never divided. He is
situated as one. Although He is the maintainer of every living entity, it is to
be understood that He devours and develops all.

PURPORT
The Lord is situated in everyone’s heart as the Supersoul. Does that mean that
He has become divided? No. Actually, He is one. The example is given of the sun:
the sun, at the meridian, is situated in his place. But if one goes for five
thousand miles in all directions and asks, “Where is the sun?” everyone will say
that it is shining on his head. In the Vedic literature this example is given to
show that although He is undivided, He is situated as if divided. Also it is
said in Vedic literature that one Viñëu is present everywhere by His
omnipotence, just as the sun appears in many places to many persons. And the
Supreme Lord, although the maintainer of every living entity, devours everything
at the time of annihilation. This was confirmed in the Eleventh Chapter when the
Lord said that He has come to devour all the warriors assembled at Kurukñetra.
He also mentions that in the form of time He devours also. He is the
annihilator, the killer of all. When there is creation, He develops all from
their original state, and at the time of annihilation He devours them. The Vedic
hymns confirm the fact that He is the origin of all living entities and the rest
of al1. After creation, everything rests in His omnipotence, and after
annihilation, everything again returns to rest in Him. These are the
confirmations of Vedic hymns. Yato vä imäni bhütäni jäyante yena jätäni jévanti
yat prayanty abhisaàviçanti tad brahma tad vijijïäsasva. (Taittiréya Upaniñad,

TRANSLATION
He is the source of light in all luminous objects. He is beyond the darkness of
matter and is unmanifested. He is knowledge, He is the object of knowledge, and
He is the goal of knowledge. He is situated in everyone’s heart.

PURPORT
The Supersoul, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the source of light in all
luminous objects like the sun, moon, stars, etc. In the Vedic literature we find
that in the spiritual kingdom there is no need of sun or moon because the
effulgence of the Supreme Lord is there. In the material world that brahmajyoti
the Lord’s spiritual effulgence, is covered by the mahat-tattva, the material
elements; therefore in this material world we require the assistance of sun,
moon, electricity, etc., for light. But in the spiritual world there is no need
of such things. It is clearly stated in the Vedic literature that because of His
luminous effulgence, everything is illuminated. It is clear, therefore, that His
situation is not in the material world. He is situated in the spiritual world
which is far, far away in the spiritual sky. That is also confirmed in the Vedic
literature. Äditya-varëam tamasaù parastät. He is just like the sun, eternally
luminous, but He is far, far beyond the darkness of this material world. His
knowledge is transcendental. The Vedic literature confirms that Brahman is
concentrated transcendental knowledge. To one who is anxious to be transferred
to that spiritual world, knowledge is given by the Supreme Lord who is situated
in everyone’s heart.

One Vedic mantra says: taà ha devam ätma-buddhi-prakäçaà mumukñur vai çaraëam
aham prapadye. One must surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead if he
at all wants liberation. As far as the goal of ultimate knowledge is concerned,
it is also confirmed in Vedic literature: tam eva viditvätimåtyum eti. “Only by
knowing You can one surpass the boundary of birth and death.” He is situated in
everyone’s heart as the supreme controller. The Supreme has legs and hands
distributed everywhere, and this cannot be said of the individual soul.
Therefore that there are two knowers of the field of activity, the individual
soul and the Supersoul, must be admitted. One’s hands and legs are distributed
locally, but Kåñëa’s hands and legs are distributed everywhere. This is
confirmed in the Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad: sarvasya prabhum éçänaà sarvasya çaraëaà
båhat. That Supreme Personality of Godhead, Supersoul, is the prabhu or master
of all living entities; therefore He is the ultimate center of all living
entities. So there is no denying the fact that the Supreme Supersoul and the
individual soul are always different.

Thus the field of activities [the body], knowledge, and the knowable have been

thus attain to My nature.

PURPORT
The Lord has described in summary the body, knowledge and the knowable. This
knowledge is of three things: the knower, the knowable and the process of
knowing. Combined, these are called vijïänam, or the science of knowledge.
Perfect knowledge can be understood by the unalloyed devotees of the Lord
directly. Others are unable to understand. The monists say that at the ultimate
stage these three items become one, but the devotees do not accept this.
Knowledge and development of knowledge mean understanding oneself in Kåñëa
consciousness. We are being led by material consciousness, but as soon as we
transfer all consciousness to Kåñëa’s activities and realize that Kåñëa is
everything, then we attain real knowledge. In other words, knowledge is nothing
but the preliminary stage of understanding devotional service perfectly.

TRANSLATION
Material nature and the living entities should be understood to be
beginningless. Their transformations and the modes of matter are products of
material nature.

PURPORT
By this knowledge, the body, the field of activities and the knowers of the body
(both the individual soul and the Supersoul) can be known. The body is the field
of activity and is composed of material nature. It is the individual soul which
is embodied. Enjoying the activities of the body is the puruña, or the living
entity. He is one knower, and the other is the Supersoul. Of course, it is to be
understood that both the Supersoul and the individual entity are different
manifestations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The living entity is in
the category of His energy, and the Supersoul is in the category of His personal
expansion.

Both material nature and the living entity are eternal. That is to say that they
existed before the creation. The material manifestation is from the energy of
the Supreme Lord and so also are the living entities, but they are of the
superior energy. Both of them existed before this cosmos was manifested.
Material nature was absorbed in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Mahä-Visëu,
and when it was required, it was manifested by the agency of mahat-tattva.
Similarly, the living entities are also in Him, and because they are
conditioned, they are adverse to serving the Supreme Lord. Thus they are not
allowed to enter into the spiritual sky. After the winding up of material
nature, these living entities are again given a chance to act in the material
world and prepare themselves to enter into the spiritual world. That is the
mystery of this material creation. Actually the living entity is originally the
spiritual part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, but due to his rebellious nature,
he is conditioned within material nature. It really does not matter how these
living entities or superior entities of the Supreme Lord have come in contact
with material nature. The Supreme Personality of Godhead knows, however, how and
why this actually took place. In the scriptures the Lord says that those
attracted by this material nature are undergoing a hard struggle for existence.
But we should know it with certainty from the descriptions of these few verses
that all the transformations and influences of material nature by the three
modes are also productions of material nature. All transformations and variety
in respect to living entities are due to the body. As far as spirit is
concerned, living entities are all the same.

TRANSLATION
Nature is said to be the cause of all material activities and effects, whereas
the living entity is the cause of the various sufferings and enjoyments in this
world.

PURPORT
The different manifestations of body and senses among the living entities are
due to material nature. There are 8,400,000 different species of life, and these
varieties are the creation of the material nature. They arise from the different
sensual pleasures of the 1iving entity, who thus desires to live in this body or
that. When he is put into different bodies, he enjoys different kinds of
happiness and distress. His material happiness and distress are due to his body,
and not to himself as he is. In his original state there is no doubt of
enjoyment; therefore that is his real state. Because of the desire to lord it
over material nature, he is in the material world. In the spiritual world there
is no such thing. The spiritual world is pure, but in the material world
everyone is struggling hard to acquire victims who present different pleasures
to the body. It might be more clear to state that this body is the effect of the
senses. The senses are instruments for gratifying desire. Now, the sum
total—body and instrument senses—are offered by material nature, and, as will be
clear in the next verse, the living entity is blessed or damned with
circumstances according to his past desire and activity. According to one’s
desires and activities, material nature places one in various residential
quarters. The being himself is the cause of his attaining such residential
quarters and his attendant enjoyment or suffering. Once placed in some
particular kind of body, he comes under the control of nature because the body,
being matter, acts according to the laws of nature. At that time, the 1iving
entity has no power to change that law. Suppose an entity is put into the body
of a dog. As soon as he is put into the body of a dog, he must act like a dog.
He cannot act otherwise. And if the living entity is put into the body of a hog,
then he is forced to eat stool and act like a hog. Similarly, if the living
entity is put into the body of a demigod, he must act according to his body.
This is the law of nature. But in all circumstances, the Supersoul is with the
individual soul. That is explained in the Vedas as follows: dvä suparëä sayujä
sakhäyä. The Supreme Lord is so kind upon the living entity that He always
accompanies the individual soul and in all circumstances is present as the
Supersoul or Paramätmä.

The living entity in material nature thus follows the ways of life, enjoying the
three modes of nature. This is due to his association with that material nature.
Thus he meets with good and evil amongst various species.

PURPORT
This verse is very important for an understanding of how the living entities
transmigrate from one body to another. It is explained in the Second Chapter
that the living entity is transmigrating from one body to another just as one
changes dress. This change of dress is due to his attachment to material
existence. As long as he is captivated by this false manifestation, he has to
continue transmigrating from one body to another. Due to his desire to lord it
over material nature, he is put into such undesirable circumstances. Under the
influence of material desire, the entity is born sometimes as a demigod,
sometimes as a man, sometimes as a beast, as a bird, as a worm, as an aquatic,
as a saintly man, as a bug. This is going on. And in all cases the living entity
thinks himself to be the master of his circumstances, yet he is under the
influence of material nature.

How he is put into such different bodies is explained here. It is due to
association with the different modes of nature. One has to rise, therefore,
above the three material modes and become situated in the transcendental
position. That is called Kåñëa consciousness. Unless one is situated in Kåñëa
consciousness, his material consciousness will oblige him to transfer from one
body to another because he has material desires since time immemorial. But he
has to change that conception. That change can be effected only by hearing from
authoritative sources. The best example is here: Arjuna is hearing the science
of God from Kåñëa. The living entity, if he submits to this hearing process,
will lose his long-cherished desire to dominate material nature, and gradually
and proportionately, as he reduces his long desire to dominate, he comes to
enjoy spiritual happiness. In a Vedic mantra it is said that as he becomes
learned in association with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he
proportionately relishes his eternal blissful life.

TRANSLATION
Yet in this body there is another, a transcendental enjoyer who is the Lord, the
supreme proprietor, who exists as the overseer and permitter, and who is known
as the Supersoul.

PURPORT
It is stated here that the Supersoul, who is always with the individual soul, is
the representation of the Supreme Lord. He is not an ordinary living entity.
Because the monist philosophers take the knower of the body to be one, they
think that there is no difference between the Supersoul and the individual soul.
To clarify this, the Lord says that He is the representation of Paramätmä in
every body. He is different from the individual soul; He is paraù,
transcendental. The individual soul enjoys the activities of a particular field,
but the Supersoul is present not as finite enjoyer nor as one taking part in
bodily activities, but as the witness, overseer, permitter and supreme enjoyer.
His name is Paramätmä, not ätmä, and He is transcendental. It is distinctly
clear that the ätmä and Paramätmä are different. The Supersoul, the Paramätmä,
has legs and hands everywhere, but the individual soul does not. And because He
is the Supreme Lord, He is present within to sanction the individual soul’s
desiring material enjoyment. Without the sanction of the Supreme Soul, the
individual soul cannot do anything. The individual is bhakta or the sustained,
and He is bhukta or the maintainer. There are innumerable living entities, and
He is staying in them as a friend.

The fact is that individual living entities are eternally part and parcel of the
Supreme Lord, and both of them are very intimately related as friends. But the
living entity has the tendency to reject the sanction of the Supreme Lord and
act independantly in an attempt to dominate the supreme nature, and because he
has this tendency, he is called the marginal energy of the Supreme Lord. The
living entity can be situated either in the material energy or the spiritual
energy. As long as he is conditioned by the material energy, the Supreme Lord,
as his friend, the Supersoul, stays with him just to get him to return to the
spiritual energy. The Lord is always eager to take him back to the spiritual
energy, but due to his minute independence, the individual entity is continually
rejecting the association of spiritual light. This misuse of independence is the
cause of his material strife in the conditioned nature. The Lord, therefore, is
always giving instruction from within and from without. From without He gives
instructions as stated in Bhagavad-gétä, and from within He tries to convince
him that his activities in the material field are not conducive to real
happiness. “Just give it up and turn your faith toward Me. Then you will be
happy,” He says. Thus the intelligent person who places his faith in the
Paramätmä or the Supreme Personality of Godhead begins to advance toward a
blissful eternal life of knowledge

TRANSLATION
One who understands this philosophy concerning material nature, the living
entity and the interaction of the modes of nature is sure to attain liberation.
He will not take birth here again, regardless of his present position.

PURPORT
Clear understanding of material nature, the Supersoul, the individual soul and
their interrelation makes one eligible to become liberated and turn to the
spiritual atmosphere without being forced to return to this material nature.
This is the result of knowledge. The purpose of knowledge is to understand
distinctly that the living entity has by chance fallen into this material
existence. By his personal endeavor in association with authorities, saintly
persons and a spiritual master, he has to understand his position and then
revert to spiritual consciousness or Kåñëa consciousness by understanding
Bhagavad-gétä as it is explained by the Personality of Godhead. Then it is
certain that he will never come again into this material existence; he will be
transferred into the spiritual world for a blissful eternal life of knowledge.

ca—also; apare—others.

TRANSLATION
That Supersoul is perceived by some through meditation, by some through the
cultivation of knowledge, and by others through working without fruitive desire.

PURPORT
The Lord informs Arjuna that the conditioned soul can be divided into two
classes as far as man’s search for self-realization is concerned. Those who are
atheists, agnostics and skeptics are beyond the sense of spiritual
understanding. But there are others who are faithful in their understanding of
spiritual life, and they are called workers who have renounced fruitive results.
Those who always try to establish the doctrine of monism are also counted among
the atheists and agnostics. In other words, only the devotees of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead are really capable of spiritual understanding because
they understand that beyond this material nature there is the spiritual world
and the Supreme Personality of Godhead who is expanded as the Paramätmä, the
Supersoul in everyone, the all-pervading Godhead. Of course there are those who
try to understand the Supreme Absolute Truth by cultivation of knowledge, and
they can be counted in the second class. The atheistic philosophers analyze this
material world into twenty-four elements, and they place the individual soul as
the twenty-fifth item. When they are able to understand the nature of the
individual soul to be transcendental to the material elements, they are able to
understand also that above the individual soul there is the Supreme Personality
of Godhead. He is the twenty-sixth element. Thus gradually they also come to the
standard of devotional service in Kåñëa consciousness. Those who work without
fruitive results are also perfect in their attitude. They are given a chance to
advance to the platform of devotional service in Kåñëa consciousness. Here it is
stated that there are some people who are pure in consciousness and who try to
find out the Supersoul by meditation, and when they discover the Supersoul
within themselves, they become transcendentally situated. Similarly, there are
others who also try to understand the Supreme Soul by cultivation of knowledge,
and there are others who cultivate the haöha-yoga system and who try to satisfy
the Supreme Personality of Godhead by childish activities.

TRANSLATION
Again there are those who, although not conversant in spiritual knowledge, begin
to worship the Supreme Person upon hearing about Him from others. Because of
their tendency to hear from authorities, they also transcend the path of birth
and death.

PURPORT
This verse is particularly applicable to modern society because in modern
society there is practically no education in spiritual matters. Some of the
people may appear to be atheistic or agnostic or philosophical, but actually
there is no knowledge of philosophy. As for the common man, if he is a good
soul, then there is a chance for advancement by hearing. This hearing process is
very important. Lord Caitanya, who preached Kåñëa consciousness in the modern
world, gave great stress to hearing because if the common man simply hears from
authoritative sources, he can progress, especially, according to Lord Caitanya,
if he hears the transcendental vibration Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa,
Hare Hare/Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare. It is stated, therefore,
that all men should take advantage of hearing from realized souls and gradually
become able to understand everything. The worship of the Supreme Lord will then
undoubtedly take place. Lord Caitanya has said that in this age no one needs to
change his position, but one should give up the endeavor to understand the
Absolute Truth by speculative reasoning. One should learn to become the servant
of those who are in knowledge of the Supreme Lord. If one is fortunate enough to
take shelter of a pure devotee, hear from him about self-realization and follow
in his footsteps, he will be gradually elevated to the position of a pure
devotee. In this verse particularly the process of hearing is strongly
recommended, and this is very appropriate. Although the common man is often not
as capable as so-called philosophers, faithful hearing from an authoritative
person will help one transcend this material existence and go back to Godhead,
back to home.

TRANSLATION
O chief of the Bhäratas, whatever you see in existence, both moving and
unmoving, is only the combination of the field of activities and the knower of
the field.

PURPORT
Both material nature and the living entity, which were existing before the
creation of the cosmos, are explained in this verse. Whatever is created is but
a combination of the living entity and material nature. There are many
manifestations like trees, mountains and hills, which are not moving, and there
are many existences which are moving, and all of them are but combinations of
material nature and superior nature, the living entity. Without the touch of the
superior nature, the living entity, nothing can grow. Therefore the relationship
between matter and nature is eternally going on, and this combination is
effected by the Supreme Lord; therefore He is the controller of both the
superior and inferior natures. The material nature is created by Him, and the
superior nature is placed in this material nature, and thus all these activities
and manifestations take place.

TRANSLATION
One who sees the Supersoul accompanying the individual soul in all bodies and
who understands that neither the soul nor the Supersoul is ever destroyed,
actually sees.

PURPORT
Anyone who can see three things—the body, the proprietor of the body, or
individual soul, and the friend of the individual soul, combined together by
good association—is actually in knowledge. Those who are not associated with the
soul’s friend are ignorant; they simply see the body, and when the body is
destroyed they think that everything is finished, but actually it is not so.
After the destruction of the body, both the soul and the Supersoul exist, and
they go on eternally in many various moving and unmoving forms. The Sanskrit
word parameçvaram is sometimes translated as the individual soul because the
soul is the master of the body, and after the destruction of the body he
transfers to another form. In that way he is master. But there are others who
interpret this parameçvaram to be the Supersoul. In either case, both the
Supersoul and the individual soul continue. They are not destroyed. One who can
see in this way can actually see what is happening.

TRANSLATION
One who sees the Supersoul in every living being and equal everywhere does not
degrade himself by his mind. Thus he approaches the transcendental destination.

PURPORT
The living entity, by accepting his material existence as just so much
suffering, can become situated in his spiritual existence. If one understands
that the Supreme is situated in His Paramätmä manifestation everywhere, that is,
if one can see the presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in every
living thing, he does not degrade himself, and he therefore gradually advances
in the spiritual world. The mind is generally addicted to self-centered
processes; but when the mind turns to the Supersoul, one becomes advanced in
spiritual understanding.

TRANSLATION
One who can see that all activities are performed by the body, which is created
of material nature, and sees that the self does nothing, actually sees.

PURPORT
This body is made by material nature under the direction of the Supersoul, and
whatever activities are going on in respect to one’s body are not his doing.
Whatever one is supposed to do, either for happiness or for distress, one is
forced to do because of the bodily constitution. The self, however, is outside
all these bodily activities. This body is given according to one’s past desires.
To fulfill desires, one is given the body, with which he acts accordingly.
Practically speaking, the body is a machine, designed by the Supreme Lord, to
fulfill desires. Because of desires, one is put into difficult circumstances to
suffer or to enjoy. This transcendental vision of the living entity, when
developed, makes one separate from bodily activities. One who has such a vision
is an actual seer.

TRANSLATION
When a sensible man ceases to see different identities, which are due to
different material bodies, he attains to the Brahman conception. Thus he sees
that beings are expanded everywhere.

PURPORT
When one can see that the various bodies of living entities arise due to the
different desires of the individual soul and do not actually belong to the soul
itself, one actually sees. In the material conception of life, we find someone a
demigod, someone a human being, a dog, a cat, etc. This is material vision, not
actual vision. This material differentiation is due to a material conception of
life. After the destruction of the material body, this spirit soul is one. The
spirit soul, due to contact with material nature, gets different types of
bodies. When one can see this, he attains spiritual vision; thus being freed
from differentiations like man, animal, big, low, etc., one becomes beautified
in his consciousness and able to develop Kåñëa consciousness in his spiritual
identity. How he then sees things will be explained in the next verse.

Those with the vision of eternity can see that the soul is transcendental,
eternal, and beyond the modes of nature. Despite contact with the material body,
O Arjuna, the soul neither does anything nor is entangled.

PURPORT
A living entity appears to be born because of the birth of the material body,
but actually the living entity is eternal; he is not born, and in spite of his
being situated in a material body, he is transcendental and eternal. Thus he
cannot be destroyed. By nature he is full of bliss. He does not engage himself
in any material activities; therefore the activities performed due to his
contact with material bodies do not entangle him.

The sky, due to its subtle nature, does not mix with anything, although it is
all-pervading. Similarly, the soul, situated in Brahman vision, does not mix
with the body, though situated in that body.

PURPORT
The air enters into water, mud, stool and whatever else is there; still it does
not mix with anything. Similarly, the living entity, even though situated in
varieties of bodies, is aloof from them due to his subtle nature. Therefore it
is impossible to see with the material eyes how the living entity is in contact
with this body and how he is out of it after the destruction of the body. No one
in science can ascertain this.

TRANSLATION
O son of Bharata, as the sun alone illuminates all this universe, so does the
living entity, one within the body, illuminate the entire body by consciousness.

PURPORT
There are various theories regarding consciousness. Here in Bhagavad-gétä the
example of the sun and the sunshine is given. As the sun is situated in one
place, but is illuminating the whole universe, so a small particle of spirit
soul, although situated in the heart of this body, is illuminating the whole
body by consciousness. Thus consciousness is the proof of the presence of the
soul, as sunshine or light is the proof of the presence of the sun.

When the soul is present in the body, there is consciousness all over the body,
and as soon as the soul has passed from the body, there is no more
consciousness. This can be easily understood by any intelligent man. Therefore
consciousness is not a production of the combinations of matter. It is the
symptom of the living entity. The consciousness of the living entity, although
qualitatively one with the supreme consciousness, is not supreme because the
consciousness of one particular body does not share that of another body. But
the Supersoul, which is situated in all bodies as the friend of the individual
soul, is conscious of all bodies. That is the difference between supreme
consciousness and individual consciousness.

TRANSLATION
One who knowingly sees this difference between the body and the owner of the
body and can understand the process of liberation from this bondage, also
attains to the supreme goal.

PURPORT
The purport of this Thirteenth Chapter is that one should know the distinction
between the body, the owner of the body, and the Supersoul. A faithful person
should at first have some good association to hear of God and thus gradually
become enlightened. If one accepts a spiritual master, he can learn to
distinguish between matter and spirit, and that becomes the steppingstone for
further spiritual realization. A spiritual master teaches his students to get
free from the material concept of life by various instructions. For instance, in
Bhagavad-gétä we find Kåñëa instructing Arjuna to free him from materialistic
considerations.

One can understand that this body is matter; it can be analyzed with its
twenty-four elements. That is the gross manifestation. And the subtle
manifestation is the mind and psychological effects. And the symptoms of life
are the interaction of these features. But over and above this, there is the
soul, and there is also the Supersoul. The soul and the Supersoul are two. This
material world is working by the conjunction of the soul and the twenty-four
material elements. One who can see the constitution of the whole material
manifestation as this combination of the soul and material elements and also can
see the situation of the Supreme Soul becomes eligible for transfer to the
spiritual world. These things are meant for contemplation and for realization,
and one should have a complete understanding of this chapter with the help of
the spiritual master.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Thirteenth Chapter of the
Çrémad-Bhagavad-gétä in the matter of Nature, the Enjoyer, and Consciousness.

The Blessed Lord said: Again I shall declare to you this supreme wisdom, the
best of all knowledge, knowing which all the sages have attained to supreme
perfection.

PURPORT
From the Seventh Chapter to the end of the Twelfth Chapter, Çré Kåñëa in detail
reveals the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Now, the Lord
Himself is further enlightening Arjuna. If one understands this chapter through
the process of philosophical speculation, he will come to an understanding of
devotional service. In the Thirteenth Chapter, it was clearly explained that by
humbly developing knowledge one may possibly be freed from material
entanglement. It has also been explained that it is due to association with the
modes of nature that the living entity is entangled in this material world. Now,
in this chapter, the Supreme Personality explains what those modes of nature
are, how they act, how they bind and how they give liberation. The knowledge
explained in this chapter is proclaimed by the Supreme Lord to be superior to
the knowledge given so far in other chapters. By understanding this knowledge,
various great sages attain perfection and transfer to the spiritual world. The
Lord now explains the same knowledge in a better way. This knowledge is far, far
superior to all other processes of knowledge thus far explained, and knowing
this many attain perfection. Thus it is expected that one who understands this
Fourteenth Chapter will attain perfection.

TRANSLATION
By becoming fixed in this knowledge, one can attain to the transcendental
nature, which is like My own nature. Thus established, one is not born at the
time of creation nor disturbed at the time of dissolution.

PURPORT
After acquiring perfect transcendental knowledge, one acquires qualitative
equality with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, becoming free from the
repetition of birth and death. One does not, however, lose his identity as an
individual soul. It is understood from Vedic literature that the liberated souls
who have reached the transcendental planets of the spiritual sky always look to
the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, being engaged in His transcendental loving
service. So, even after liberation, the devotees do not lose their individual
identities.

Generally, in the material world, whatever knowledge we get is contaminated by
the three modes of material nature. But knowledge which is not contaminated by
the three modes of nature is called transcendental knowledge. As soon as one is
situated in that transcendental knowledge, he is on the same platform as that of
the Supreme Person. Those who have no knowledge of the spiritual sky hold that
after being freed from the material activities of the material form, this
spiritual identity becomes formless, without any variegatedness. However, just
as there is material variegatedness in this world, so, in the spiritual world,
there is also variegatedness. Those in ignorance of this think that spiritual
existence is opposed to material variety. But actually, in the spiritual sky,
one attains spiritual form. There are spiritual activities, and the spiritual
situation is called devotional life. That atmosphere is said to be
uncontaminated, and there one is equal in quality with the Supreme Lord. To
obtain such knowledge, one must develop all the spiritual qualities. One who
thus develops the spiritual qualities is not affected either by the creation or
the destruction of the material world.

TRANSLATION
The total material substance, called Brahman, is the source of birth, and it is
that Brahman that I impregnate, making possible the births of all living beings,
O son of Bharata.

PURPORT
This is an explanation of the world: everything that takes place is due to the
combination of kñetra and kñetrajïa, the body and the spirit soul. This
combination of material nature and the living entity is made possible by the
Supreme God Himself. The mahat-tattva is the total cause of the total cosmic
manifestation, and because in the total substance of the material cause there
are three modes of nature, it is sometimes called Brahman. The Supreme
Personality impregnates that total substance, and thus innumerable universes
become possible. This total material substance, the mahat-tattva, is described
as Brahman in the Vedic literature: tasmäd etad brahma näma-rüpam annaà ca
jäyate. Into that Brahman the seeds of the living entities are impregnated by
the Supreme Person. The twenty-four elements, beginning from earth, water, fire
and air, are all material energy, called Mahä-brahman, or the great Brahman, the
material nature. As is explained in the Seventh Chapter, beyond this there is
another, superior nature—the living entity. In material nature the superior
nature is mixed by the will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and
thereafter all living entities are born of this material nature.

The scorpion lays its eggs in piles of rice, and sometimes it is said that the
scorpion is born out of rice. But the rice is not the cause of the scorpion.
Actually, the eggs were laid by the mother. Similarly, material nature is not
the cause of the birth of the living entities. The seed is given by the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, and they only seem to come out as products of material
nature. Thus every living entity, according to his past activities, has a
different body, created by this material nature, and the entity can enjoy or
suffer according to his past deeds. The Lord is the cause of all the
manifestations of living entities in this material world.

TRANSLATION
It should be understood that all species of life, O son of Kunté, are made
possible by birth in this material nature, and that I am the seed-giving father.

PURPORT
In this verse it is clearly explained that the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
Kåñëa, is the original father of all living entities. The living entities are
combinations of the material nature and the spiritual nature. Such living
entities are seen not only on this planet, but in every planet, even in the
highest where Brahmä is situated. Everywhere there are living entities; within
the earth there are living entities, even within water and within fire. All
these appearances are due to the mother, material nature, and Kåñëa’s
seed-giving process. The purport is that the living entities, being impregnated
in the material world, come out and form at the time of creation according to
their past deeds.

TRANSLATION
Material nature consists of the three modes—goodness, passion and ignorance.
When the living entity comes in contact with nature, he becomes conditioned by
these modes.

PURPORT
The living entity, because he is transcendental, has nothing to do with this
material nature. Still, because he has become conditioned by the material world,
he is acting under the spell of the three modes of material nature. Because
living entities have different kinds of bodies, in terms of the different
aspects of nature, they are induced to act according to that nature. This is the
cause of the varieties of happiness and distress.

TRANSLATION
O sinless one, the mode of goodness, being purer than the others, is
illuminating, and it frees one from all sinful reactions. Those situated in that
mode develop knowledge, but they become conditioned by the concept of happiness.

PURPORT
The living entities conditioned by material nature are of various types. One is
happy, another is very active, and another is helpless. All these types of
psychological manifestations are causes of the entities’ conditioned status in
nature. How they are differently conditioned is explained in this section of
Bhagavad-gétä. The mode of goodness is first considered. The effect of
developing the mode of goodness in the material world is that one becomes wiser
than those otherwise conditioned. A man in the mode of goodness is not so much
affected by material miseries, and he has a sense of advancement in material
knowledge. The representative type is the brähmaëa, who is supposed to be
situated in the mode of goodness. This sense of happiness is due to
understanding that, in the mode of goodness, one is more or less free from
sinful reactions. Actually, in the Vedic literature it is said that the mode of
goodness means greater knowledge and a greater sense of happiness.

The difficulty here is that when a living entity is situated in the mode of
goodness, he becomes conditioned to feel that he is advanced in knowledge and is
better than others. In this way he becomes conditioned. The best examples are
the scientist and philosopher: each is very proud of his knowledge, and because
they generally improve their living conditions, they feel a sort of material
happiness. This sense of advanced happiness in conditioned life makes them bound
by the mode of goodness of material nature. As such, they are attracted toward
working in the mode of goodness, and, as long as they have an attraction for
working in that way, they have to take some type of body in the modes of nature.
Thus there is no likelihood of liberation, or of being transferred to the
spiritual world. Repeatedly, one may become a philosopher, a scientist, or a
poet, and, repeatedly, become entangled in the same disadvantages of birth and
death. But, due to the illusion of the material energy, one thinks that that
sort of life is pleasant.

TRANSLATION
The mode of passion is born of unlimited desires and longings, O son of Kunté,
and because of this one is bound to material fruitive activities.

PURPORT
The mode of passion is characterized by the attraction between man and woman.
Woman has attraction for man, and man has attraction for woman. This is called
the mode of passion. And, when the mode of passion is increased, one develops
the hankering for material enjoyment. He wants to enjoy sense gratification. For
sense gratification, a man in the mode of passion wants some honor in society,
or in the nation, and he wants to have a happy family, with nice children, wife,
and house. These are the products of the mode of passion. As long as one is
hankering after these things, he has to work very hard. Therefore it is clearly
stated here that he becomes associated with the fruits of his activities and
thus becomes bound by such activities. In order to please his wife, children and
society and to keep up his prestige, one has to work. Therefore, the whole
material world is more or less in the mode of passion. Modern civilization is
considered to be advanced in the standards of the mode of passion. Formerly, the
advanced condition was considered to be in the mode of goodness. If there is no
liberation for those in the mode of goodness, what of those who are entangled in
the mode of passion?

TRANSLATION
O son of Bharata, the mode of ignorance causes the delusion of all living
entities. The result of this mode is madness, indolence and sleep, which bind
the conditioned soul.

PURPORT
In this verse the specific application of the word tu is very significant. This
means that the mode of ignorance is a very peculiar qualification of the
embodied soul. This mode of ignorance is just the opposite of the mode of
goodness. In the mode of goodness, by development of knowledge, one can
understand what is what, but the mode of ignorance is just the opposite.
Everyone under the spell of the mode of ignorance becomes mad, and a madman
cannot understand what is what. Instead of making advancement, one becomes
degraded. The definition of the mode of ignorance is stated in the Vedic
literature: under the spell of ignorance, one cannot understand the thing as it
is. For example, everyone can see that his grandfather has died, and therefore
he will also die; man is mortal. The children that he conceives will also die.
So death is sure. Still, people are madly accumulating money and working very
hard all day and night, not caring for the eternal spirit. This is madness. In
their madness, they are very reluctant to make advancement in spiritual
understanding. Such people are very lazy. When they are invited to associate for
spiritual understanding, they are not much interested. They are not even active
like the man who is controlled by the mode of passion. Thus another symptom of
one embedded in the mode of ignorance is that he sleeps more than is required.
Six hours of sleep is sufficient, but a man in the mode of ignorance sleeps at
least ten or twelve hours a day. Such a man appears to be always dejected, and
is addicted to intoxicants and sleeping. These are the symptoms of a person
conditioned by the mode of ignorance.

TRANSLATION
The mode of goodness conditions one to happiness, passion conditions him to the
fruits of action, and ignorance to madness.

PURPORT
A person in the mode of goodness is satisfied by his work or intellectual
pursuit, just as a philosopher, scientist, or educator may be engaged in a
particular field of knowledge and may be satisfied in that way. A man in the
modes of passion and goodness may be engaged in fruitive activity; he owns as
much as he can and spends for good causes. Sometimes he tries to open hospitals,
give to charity institutions, etc. These are the signs of one in the mode of
passion. And the mode of ignorance covers knowledge. In the mode of ignorance,
whatever one does is neither good for him nor for anyone.

TRANSLATION
Sometimes the mode of passion becomes prominent, defeating the mode of goodness,
O son of Bharata. And sometimes the mode of goodness defeats passion, and at
other times the mode of ignorance defeats goodness and passion. In this way
there is always competition for supremacy.

PURPORT
When the mode of passion is prominent, the modes of goodness and ignorance are
defeated. When the mode of goodness is prominent, passion and ignorance are
defeated. And, when the mode of ignorance is prominent, passion and goodness are
defeated. This competition is always going on. Therefore, one who is actually
intent on advancing in Kåñëa consciousness has to transcend these three modes.
The prominence of some certain mode of nature is manifested in one’s dealings,
in his activities, in eating, etc. All this will be explained in later chapters.
But if one wants, he can develop, by practice, the mode of goodness and thus
defeat the modes of ignorance and passion. One can similarly develop the mode of
passion and defeat goodness and ignorance. Or, one can develop the mode of
ignorance and defeat goodness and passion. Although there are these three modes
of material nature, if one is determined, he can be blessed by the mode of
goodness, and, by transcending the mode of goodness, he can be situated in pure
goodness, which is called the väsudeva state, a state in which one can
understand the science of God. By the manifestation of particular activities, it
can be understood in what mode of nature one is situated.

PURPORT
There are nine gates in the body: two eyes, two ears, two nostrils, the mouth,
the genital and the anus. In every gate, when the symptom of goodness is
illuminated, it should be understood that one has developed the mode of
goodness. In the mode of goodness, one can see things in the right position, one
can hear things in the right position, and one can taste things in the right
position. One becomes cleansed inside and outside. In every gate there is
development of the symptoms of happiness, and that is the position of goodness.

O chief of the Bhäratas, when there is an increase in the mode of passion, the
symptoms of great attachment, uncontrollable desire, hankering, and intense

PURPORT
One in the mode of passion is never satisfied with the position he has already
acquired; he hankers to increase his position. If he wants to construct a
residential house, he tries his best to have a palatial house, as if he would be
able to reside in that house eternally. And he develops a great hankering for
sense gratification. There is no end to sense gratification. He always wants to
remain with his family and in his house and to continue the process of sense
gratification. There is no cessation of this. All these symptoms should be
understood as characteristic of the mode of passion.

O son of Kuru, when there is an increase in the mode of ignorance madness,
illusion, inertia and darkness are manifested.

PURPORT
When there is no illumination, knowledge is absent. One in the mode of ignorance
does not work by a regulative principle; he wants to act whimsically for no
purpose. Even though he has the capacity to work, he makes no endeavor. This is
called illusion. Although consciousness is going on, life is inactive. These are
the symptoms of one in the mode of ignorance.

When one dies in the mode of goodness, he attains to the pure higher planets.

PURPORT
One in goodness attains higher planetary systems, like Brahmaloka or Janaloka,
and there enjoys godly happiness. The word amalän is significant; it means free
from the modes of passion and ignorance. There are impurities in the material
world, but the mode of goodness is the purest form of existence in the material
world. There are different kinds of planets for different kinds of living
entities. Those who die in the mode of goodness are elevated to the planets
where great sages and great devotees live.

When one dies in the mode of passion, he takes birth among those engaged in
fruitive activities; and when he dies in the mode of ignorance, he takes birth
in the animal kingdom.

PURPORT
Some people have the impression that when the soul reaches the platform of human
life, it never goes down again. This is incorrect. According to this verse, if
one develops the mode of ignorance, after his death he is degraded to the animal
form of life. From there one has to again elevate himself, by evolutionary
process, to come again to the human form of life. Therefore, those who are
actually serious about human life should take to the mode of goodness and in
good association transcend the modes and become situated in Kåñëa consciousness.
This is the aim of human life. Otherwise, there is no guarantee that the human
being will again attain to the human status.

TRANSLATION
By acting in the mode of goodness, one becomes purified. Works done in the mode
of passion result in distress, and actions performed in the mode of ignorance
result in foolishness.

PURPORT
By pious activities in the mode of goodness one is purified; therefore the
sages, who are free from all illusion, are situated in happiness. Similarly,
activities in the mode of passion are simply miserable. Any activity for
material happiness is bound to be defeated. If, for example, one wants to have a
skyscraper, so much human misery has to be undergone before a big skyscraper can
be built. The financier has to take much trouble to earn a mass of wealth, and
those who are slaving to construct the building have to render physical toil.
The miseries are there. Thus Bhagavad-gétä says that in any activity performed
under the spell of the mode of passion, there is definitely great misery. There
may be a little so-called mental happiness—“I have this house or this money”—but
this is not actual happiness. As far as the mode of ignorance is concerned, the
performer is without knowledge, and therefore all his activities result in
present misery, and afterwards he will go on toward animal life. Animal life is
always miserable, although, under the spell of the illusory energy, mäyä, the
animals do not understand this. Slaughtering poor animals is also due to the
mode of ignorance. The animal killers do not know that in the future the animal
will have a body suitable to kill them. That is the law of nature. In human
society, if one kills a man he has to be hanged. That is the law of the state.
Because of ignorance, people do not perceive that there is a complete state
controlled by the Supreme Lord. Every living creature is the son of the Supreme
Lord, and He does not tolerate even an ant’s being killed. One has to pay for
it. So, indulgence in animal killing for the taste of the tongue is the grossest
kind of ignorance. A human being has no need to kill animals because God has
supplied so many nice things. If one indulges in meat-eating anyway, it is to be
understood that he is acting in ignorance and is making his future very dark. Of
all kinds of animal killing, the killing of cows is most vicious because the cow
gives us all kinds of pleasure by supplying milk. Cow slaughter is an act of the
grossest type of ignorance. In the Vedic literature the words gobhiù
préëita-matsaram indicate that one who, being fully satisfied by milk, is
desirous of killing the cow, is in the grossest ignorance. There is also a
prayer in the Vedic literature that states:

namo brahmaëya-deväya go-brähmaëa-hitäya ca
jagaddhitäya kåñëäya govindäya namo namaù.

“My Lord, You are the well-wisher of the cows and the brähmaëas, and You are the
well-wisher of the entire human society and world.” The purport is that special
mention is given in that prayer for the protection of the cows and the
brähmaëas. Brähmaëas are the symbol of spiritual education, and cows are the
symbol of the most valuable food; these two living creatures, the brähmaëas and
the cows, must be given all protection—that is real advancement of civilization.
In modern human society, spiritual knowledge is neglected, and cow killing is
encouraged. It is to be understood, then, that human society is advancing in the
wrong direction and is clearing the path to its own condemnation. A civilization
which guides the citizens to become animals in their next lives is certainly not
a human civilization. The present human civilization is, of course, grossly
misled by the modes of passion and ignorance. It is a very dangerous age, and
all nations should take care to provide the easiest process, Kåñëa
consciousness, to save humanity from the greatest danger.

TRANSLATION
From the mode of goodness, real knowledge develops; from the mode of passion,
grief develops; and from the mode of ignorance, foolishness, madness and
illusion develop.

PURPORT
Since the present civilization is not very congenial to the living entities,
Kåñëa consciousness is recommended. Through Kåñëa consciousness, society will
develop the mode of goodness. When the mode of goodness is developed, people
will see things as they are. In the mode of ignorance, people are just like
animals and cannot see things clearly. In the mode of ignorance, for example,
they do not see that by killing one animal they are taking a chance of being
killed by the same animal in the next life. Because people have no education in
actual knowledge, they become irresponsible. To stop this irresponsibility,
education for developing the mode of goodness of the people in general must be
there. When they are actually educated in the mode of goodness, they will become
sober, in full knowledge of things as they are. Then people will be happy and
prosperous. Even if the majority of the people aren’t happy and prosperous, if a
certain percentage of the population develops Kåñëa consciousness and becomes
situated in the mode of goodness, then there is the possibility for peace and
prosperity all over the world. Otherwise, if the world is devoted to the modes
of passion and ignorance, there can be no peace or prosperity. In the mode of
passion, people become greedy, and their hankering for sense enjoyment has no
limit. One can see that even if one has enough money and adequate arrangement
for sense gratification, there is neither happiness nor peace of mind. That is
not possible because one is situated in the mode of passion. If one wants
happiness at all, his money will not help him; he has to elevate himself to the
mode of goodness by practicing Kåñëa consciousness. One engaged in the mode of
passion is not only mentally unhappy, but his profession and occupation are also
very troublesome. He has to devise so many plans and schemes to acquire enough
money to maintain his status quo. This is all miserable. In the mode of
ignorance, people become mad. Being distressed by their circumstances, they take
shelter of intoxication, and thus they sink further into ignorance. Their future
in life is very dark.

TRANSLATION
Those situated in the mode of goodness gradually go upward to the higher
planets; those in the mode of passion live on the earthly planets; and those in
the mode of ignorance go down to the hellish worlds.

PURPORT
In this verse the results of actions in the three modes of nature are more
explicitly set forth. There is an upper planetary system, consisting of the
heavenly planets, where everyone is highly elevated. According to the degree of
development of the mode of goodness, the living entity can be transferred to
various planets in this system. The highest planet is Satyaloka, or Brahmaloka,
where the prime person of this universe, Lord Brahmä, resides. We have seen
already that we can hardly calculate the wondrous condition of life in
Brahmaloka, but the highest condition of life, the mode of goodness, can bring
us to this.

The mode of passion is mixed. It is in the middle, between the modes of goodness
and ignorance. A person is not always pure, but even if he should be purely in
the mode of passion, he will simply remain on this earth as a king or a rich
man. But because there are mixtures, one can also go down. People on this earth,
in the modes of passion or ignorance, cannot forcibly approach the higher
planets by machine. In the mode of passion, there is also the chance of becoming
mad in the next life.

The lowest quality, the mode of ignorance, is described here as abominable. The
result of developing ignorance is very, very risky. It is the lowest quality in
material nature. Beneath the human level there are eight million species of
life: birds, beasts, reptiles, trees, etc., and, according to the development of
the mode of ignorance, people are brought down to these abominable conditions.
The word tämasäù is very significant here. Tämasäù indicates those who stay
continually in the mode of ignorance without rising to a higher mode. Their
future is very dark.

There is opportunity for men in the modes of ignorance and passion to be
elevated to the mode of goodness, and that system is called Kåñëa consciousness.
But one who does not take advantage of this opportunity certainly will continue
in the lower modes.

TRANSLATION
When you see that there is nothing beyond these modes of nature in all
activities and that the Supreme Lord is transcendental to all these modes, then
you can know My spiritual nature.

PURPORT
One can transcend all the activities of the modes of material nature simply by
understanding them properly by learning from the proper souls. The real
spiritual master is Kåñëa, and He is imparting this spiritual knowledge to
Arjuna. Similarly, it is from those who are fully in Kåñëa consciousness that
one has to learn this science of activities in terms of the modes of nature.
Otherwise, one’s life will be misdirected. By the instruction of a bona fide
spiritual master, a living entity can know of his spiritual position, his
material body, his senses, how he is entrapped, and how he is under the spell of
the material modes of nature. He is helpless, being in the grip of these modes,
but when he can see his real position, then he can attain to the transcendental
platform, having the scope for spiritual life. Actually, the living entity is
not the performer of different activities. He is forced to act because he is
situated in a particular type of body, conducted by some particular mode of
material nature. Unless one has the help of spiritual authority, he cannot
understand in what position he is actually situated. With the association of a
bona fide spiritual master, he can see his real position, and, by such an
understanding, he can become fixed in full Kåñëa consciousness. A man in Kåñëa
consciousness is not controlled by the spell of the material modes of nature. It
has already been stated in the Seventh Chapter that one who has surrendered to
Kåñëa is relieved from the activities of material nature. Therefore for one who
is able to see things as they are, the influence of material nature gradually
ceases.

TRANSLATION
When the embodied being is able to transcend these three modes, he can become
free from birth, death, old age and their distresses and can enjoy nectar even
in this life.

PURPORT
How one can stay in the transcendental position, even in this body, in full
Kåñëa consciousness, is explained in this verse. The Sanskrit word dehé means
embodied. Although one is within this material body, by his advancement in
spiritual knowledge he can be free from the influence of the modes of nature. He
can enjoy the happiness of spiritual life even in this body because, after
leaving this body, he is certainly going to the spiritual sky. But even in this
body he can enjoy spiritual happiness. In other words, devotional service in
Kåñëa consciousness is the sign of liberation from this material entanglement,
and this will be explained in the Eighteenth Chapter. When one is freed from the
influence of the modes of material nature, he enters into devotional service.

TRANSLATION
Arjuna inquired: O my dear Lord, by what symptoms is one known who is
transcendental to those modes? What is his behavior? And how does he transcend
the modes of nature?

PURPORT
In this verse, Arjuna’s questions are very appropriate. He wants to know the
symptoms of a person who has already transcended the material modes. He first
inquires of the symptoms of such a transcendental person. How can one understand
that he has already transcended the influence of the modes of material nature?
The second question asks how he lives and what his activities are. Are they
regulated or nonregulated? Then Arjuna inquires of the means by which he can
attain the transcendental nature. That is very important. Unless one knows the
direct means by which one can be situated always transcendentally, there is no
possibility of showing the symptoms. So all these questions put by Arjuna are
very important, and the Lord answers them.

TRANSLATION
The Blessed Lord said: He who does not hate illumination, attachment and
delusion when they are present, nor longs for them when they disappear; who is
seated like one unconcerned, being situated beyond these material reactions of
the modes of nature, who remains firm, knowing that the modes alone are active;
who regards alike pleasure and pain, and looks on a clod, a stone and a piece of
gold with an equal eye; who is wise and holds praise and blame to be the same;
who is unchanged in honor and dishonor, who treats friend and foe alike, who has
abandoned all fruitive undertakings—such a man is said to have transcended the
modes of nature.

PURPORT
Arjuna submitted the three different questions, and the Lord answers them one
after another. In these verses, Kåñëa first indicates that a person
transcendentally situated neither envies anyone nor hankers for anything. When a
living entity stays in this material world embodied by the material body, it is
to be understood that he is under the control of one of the three modes of
material nature. When he is actually out of the body, then he is out of the
clutches of the material modes of nature. But as long as he is not out of the
material body, he should be neutral. He should engage himself in the devotional
service of the Lord so that his identity with the material body will
automatically be forgotten. When one is conscious of the material body, he acts
only for sense gratification, but when one transfers the consciousness to Kåñëa,
sense gratification automatically stops. One does not need this material body,
and he does not need to accept the dictations of the material body. The
qualities of the material modes in the body will act, but as spirit soul the
self is aloof from such activities. How does he become aloof? He does not desire
to enjoy the body, nor does he desire to get out of it. Thus transcendentally
situated, the devotee becomes automatically free. He need not try to become free
from the influence of the modes of material nature.

The next question concerns the dealings of a transcendentally situated person.
The materially situated person is affected by so-called honor and dishonor
offered to the body, but the transcendentally situated person is not affected by
such false honor and dishonor. He performs his duty in Kåñëa consciousness and
does not mind whether a man honors or dishonors him. He accepts things that are
favorable for his duty in Kåñëa consciousness, otherwise he has no necessity of
anything material, either a stone or gold. He takes everyone as his dear friend
who helps him in his execution of Kåñëa consciousness, and he does not hate his
so-called enemy. He is equally disposed and sees everything on an equal level
because he knows perfectly well that he has nothing to do with material
existence. Social and political issues do not affect him because he knows the
situation of temporary upheavals and disturbances. He does not attempt anything
for his own sake. He can attempt anything for Kåñëa, but for his personal self
he does not attain anything. By such behavior one becomes actually
transcendentally situated.

TRANSLATION
One who engages in full devotional service, who does not fall down in any
circumstance, at once transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to
the level of Brahman.

PURPORT
This verse is a reply to Arjuna’s third question: What is the means of attaining
to the transcendental position? As explained before, the material world is
acting under the spell of the modes of material nature. One should not be
disturbed by the activities of the modes of nature; instead of putting his
consciousness into such activities, he may transfer his consciousness to Kåñëa
activities. Kåñëa activities are known as bhakti-yoga—always acting for Kåñëa.
This includes not only Kåñëa, but His different plenary expansions such as Räma
and Näräyaëa. He has innumerable expansions. One who is engaged in the service
of any of the forms of Kåñëa, or of His plenary expansions, is considered to be
transcendentally situated. One should also note that all the forms of Kåñëa are
fully transcendental, blissful, full of knowledge and eternal. Such
personalities of Godhead are omnipotent and omniscient, and they possess all
transcendental qualities. So, if one engages himself in the service of Kåñëa or
His plenary expansions with unfailing determination, although these modes of
material nature are very difficult to overcome, he can overcome them easily.
This is already explained in the Seventh Chapter. One who surrenders unto Kåñëa
at once surmounts the influence of the modes of material nature. To be in Kåñëa
consciousness or in devotional service means to acquire the equality of Kåñëa.
The Lord says that His nature is eternal, blissful and full of knowledge, and
the living entities are part and parcel of the Supreme, as gold particles are
part of a gold mine. Thus the living entity’s spiritual position is as good as
gold, as good as Kåñëa in quality. The difference of individuality continues,
otherwise there is no question of bhakti-yoga. Bhakti-yoga means that the Lord
is there, the devotee is there and the activity of exchange of love between the
Lord and the devotee is there. Therefore the individuality of two persons is
present in the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the individual person,
otherwise there is no meaning to bhakti-yoga. If one is not situated in the same
transcendental position with the Lord, one cannot serve the Supreme Lord. To be
a personal assistant to a king, one must acquire the qualifications. Thus the
qualification is to become Brahman, or freed from all material contamination. It
is said in the Vedic literature: brahmaiva san brahmäpyeti. One can attain the
Supreme Brahman by becoming Brahman. This means that one must qualitatively
become one with Brahman. By attainment of Brahman, one does not lose his eternal
Brahman identity as individual soul.

TRANSLATION
And I am the basis of the impersonal Brahman, which is the constitutional
position of ultimate happiness, and which is immortal, imperishable and eternal.

PURPORT
The constitution of Brahman is immortality, imperishability, eternity, and
happiness. Brahman is the beginning of transcendental realization. Paramätmä,
the Supersoul, is the middle, the second stage in transcendental realization,
and the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ultimate realization of the
Absolute Truth. Therefore, both Paramätmä and the impersonal Brahman are within
the Supreme Person. It is explained in the Seventh Chapter that material nature
is the manifestation of the inferior energy of the Supreme Lord. The Lord
impregnates the inferior material nature with the fragments of the superior
nature, and that is the spiritual touch in the material nature. When a living
entity conditioned by this material nature begins the cultivation of spiritual
knowledge, he elevates himself from the position of material existence and
gradually rises up to the Brahman conception of the Supreme. This attainment of
the Brahman conception of life is the first stage in self-realization. At this
stage the Brahman realized person is transcendental to the material position,
but he is not actually perfect in Brahman realization. If he wants, he can
continue to stay in the Brahman position and then gradually rise up to Paramätmä
realization and then to the realization of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
There are many examples of this in Vedic literature. The four Kumäras were
situated first in the impersonal Brahman conception of truth, but then they
gradually rose to the platform of devotional service. One who cannot elevate
himself beyond the impersonal conception of Brahman runs the risk of falling
down. In Çrémad-Bhägavatam it is stated that although a person may rise to the
stage of impersonal Brahman, without going farther, with no information of the
Supreme Person, his intelligence is not perfectly clear. Therefore, in spite of
being raised to the Brahman platform, there is the chance of falling down if one
is not engaged in the devotional service of the Lord. In the Vedic language it
is also said: raso vai saù; rasaà hy eväyaà labdhvänandé bhavati. “When one
understands the Personality of God, the reservoir of pleasure, Kåñëa, he
actually becomes transcendentally blissful.” The Supreme Lord is full in six
opulences, and when a devotee approaches Him, there is an exchange of these six
opulences. The servant of the king enjoys on an almost equal level with the
king. And so, eternal happiness, imperishable happiness, eternal life accompany
devotional service. Therefore, realization of Brahman, or eternity, or
imperishability is included in devotional service. This is already possessed by
a person who is engaged in devotional service.

The living entity, although Brahman by nature, has the desire to lord it over
the material world, and due to this he falls down. In his constitutional
position, a living entity is above the three modes of material nature, but
association with material nature entangles him in the different modes of
material nature, goodness, passion and ignorance. Due to the association of
these three modes, his desire to dominate the material world is there. By
engagement in devotional service in full Kåñëa consciousness, he is immediately
situated in the transcendental position, and his unlawful desire to control
material nature is removed. Therefore the process of devotional service
beginning with hearing, chanting, remembering—the prescribed nine methods for
realizing devotional service—should be practiced in the association of devotees.
Gradually, by such association, by the influence of the spiritual master, one’s
material desire to dominate is removed, and one becomes firmly situated in the
Lord’s transcendental loving service. This method is prescribed from the
twenty-second to the last verse of this chapter. Devotional service to the Lord
is very simple: one should always engage in the service of the Lord, should eat
the remnants of foodstuffs offered to the Deity, smell the flowers offered to
the lotus feet of the Lord, see the places where the Lord had His transcendental
pastimes, read of the different activities of the Lord, His reciprocation of
love with His devotees, chant always the transcendental vibration Hare Kåñëna,
Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare,
and observe the fasting days commemorating the appearances and disappearances of
the Lord and His devotees. By following such a process one becomes completely
detached from all material activities. One who can thus situate himself in the
brahmajyoti is equal to the Supreme Personality of Godhead in quality.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Fourteenth Chapter of the
Çrémad-Bhagavad-gétä in the matter of the Three Modes of Material Nature.

TRANSLATION
The Blessed Lord said: There is a banyan tree which has its roots upward and its
branches down and whose leaves are the Vedic hymns. One who knows this tree is
the knower of the Vedas.

PURPORT
After the discussion of the importance of bhakti-yoga, one may question, “What
about the Vedas?” It is explained in this chapter that the purpose of Vedic
study is to understand Kåñëa. Therefore one who is in Kåñëa consciousness, who
is engaged in devotional service, already knows the Vedas.

The entanglement of this material world is compared here to a banyan tree. For
one who is engaged in fruitive activities, there is no end to the banyan tree.
He wanders from one branch to another, to another, to another. The tree of this
material world has no end, and for one who is attached to this tree, there is no
possibility of liberation. The Vedic hymns, meant for elevating oneself, are
called the leaves of this tree. This tree’s roots grow upward because they begin
from where Brahmä is located, the topmost planet of this universe. If one can
understand this indestructible tree of illusion, then one can get out of it.

This process of extrication should be understood. In the previous chapters it
has been explained that there are many processes by which to get out of the
material entanglement. And, up to the Thirteenth Chapter, we have seen that
devotional service to the Supreme Lord is the best way. Now, the basic principle
of devotional service is detachment from material activities and attachment to
the transcendental service of the Lord. The process of breaking attachment to
the material world is discussed in the beginning of this chapter. The root of
this material existence grows upward. This means that it begins from the total
material substance, from the topmost planet of the universe. From there, the
whole universe is expanded, with so many branches, representing the various
planetary systems. The fruits represent the results of the living entities’
activities, namely, religion, economic development, sense gratification and
liberation.

Now, there is no ready experience in this world of a tree situated with its
branches down and its roots upward, but there is such a thing. That tree can be
found beside a reservoir of water. We can see that the trees on the bank reflect
upon the water with their branches down and roots up. In other words, the tree
of this material world is only a reflection of the real tree of the spiritual
world. This reflection of the spiritual world is situated on desire, just as the
tree’s reflection is situated on water. Desire is the cause of things’ being
situated in this reflected material light. One who wants to get out of this
material existence must know this tree thoroughly through analytical study. Then
he can cut off his relationship with it.

This tree, being the reflection of the real tree, is an exact replica.
Everything is there in the spiritual world. The impersonalists take Brahmä to be
the root of this material tree, and from the root, according to säìkhya
philosophy, come prakåti, puruña, then the three guëas, then the five gross
elements (païca-mahäbhüta), then the ten senses (daçendriya), mind, etc. In this
way they divide up the whole material world. If Brahmä is the center of all
manifestations, then this material world is a manifestation of the center by 180
degrees, and the other 180 degrees constitute the spiritual world. The material
world is the perverted reflection, so the spiritual world must have the same
variegatedness, but in reality. The prakåti is the external energy of the
Supreme Lord, and the puruña is the Supreme Lord Himself, and that is explained
in Bhagavad-gétä. Since this manifestation is material, it is temporary. A
reflection is temporary, for it is sometimes seen and sometimes not seen. But
the origin from whence the reflection is reflected is eternal. The material
reflection of the real tree has to be cut off. When it is said that a person
knows the Vedas, it is assumed that he knows how to cut off attachment to this
material world. If one knows that process, he actually knows the Vedas. One who
is attracted by the ritualistic formulas of the Vedas is attracted by the
beautiful green leaves of the tree. He does not exactly know the purpose of the
Vedas. The purpose of the Vedas, as disclosed by the Personality of Godhead
Himself, is to cut down this reflected tree and attain the real tree of the
spiritual world.

TRANSLATION
The branches of this tree extend downward and upward, nourished by the three
modes of material nature. The twigs are the objects of the senses. This tree
also has roots going down, and these are bound to the fruitive actions of human
society.

PURPORT
The description of the banyan tree is further explained here. Its branches are
spread in all directions. In the lower parts, there are variegated
manifestations of living entities, such as human beings, animals, horses, cows,
dogs, cats, etc. These are situated on the lower parts of the branches, whereas
on the upper parts are higher forms of living entities: the demigods, Gandharvas
(fairies), and many other higher species of life. As a tree is nourished by
water, so this tree is nourished by the three modes of material nature.
Sometimes we find that a tract of land is barren for want of sufficient water,
and sometimes a tract is very green; similarly, where the modes of material
nature are proportionately greater in quantity, the different species of life
are manifested in that proportion.

The twigs of the tree are considered to be the sense objects. By development of
the different modes of nature, we develop different senses, and, by the senses,
we enjoy different varieties of sense objects. The source of the senses—the
ears, the nose, eyes, etc.—is considered to be the upper twigs, tuned to the
enjoyment of different sense objects. The leaves are sound, form, touch—the
sense objects. The roots, which are subsidiary, are the by-products of different
varieties of suffering and sense enjoyment. Thus we develop attachment and
aversion. The tendencies toward piety and impiety are considered to be the
secondary roots, spreading in all directions. The real root is from Brahmaloka,
and the other roots are in the human planetary systems. After one enjoys the
results of virtuous activities in the upper planetary systems, he comes down to
this earth and renews his karma or fruitive activities for promotion. This
planet of human beings is considered the field of activities.

TRANSLATION
The real form of this tree cannot be perceived in this world. No one can
understand where it ends, where it begins, or where its foundation is. But with
determination one must cut down this tree with the weapon of detachment. So
doing, one must seek that place from which, having once gone, one never returns,
and there surrender to that Supreme Personality of Godhead from whom everything
has begun and in whom everything is abiding since time immemorial.

PURPORT
It is now clearly stated that the real form of this banyan tree cannot be
understood in this material world. Since the root is upwards, the extension of
the real tree is at the other end. No one can see how far the tree extends, nor
can one see the beginning of this tree. Yet one has to find out the cause. “I am
the son of my father, my father is the son of such and such a person, etc.” By
searching in this way, one comes to Brahmä, who is generated by the
Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu. Finally, in this way, when one reaches to the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, that is the end of research work. One has to search out
that origin of this tree, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, through the
association of persons who are in the knowledge of that Supreme Personality of
Godhead. Then by understanding one becomes gradually detached from this false
reflection of reality, and by knowledge one can cut off the connection and
actually become situated in the real tree.

The word asaìga is very important in this connection because the attachment for
sense enjoyment and lording it over the material nature is very strong.
Therefore one must learn detachment by discussion of spiritual science based on
authoritative scriptures, and one must hear from persons who are actually in
knowledge. As a result of such discussion in the association of devotees, one
comes to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Then the first thing one must do is
surrender to Him. The description of that place whence going no one returns to
this false reflected tree is given here. The Supreme Personality of Godhead,
Kåñëa, is the original root from whom everything has emanated. To gain favor of
that Personality of Godhead, one has only to surrender, and this is a result of
performing devotional service by hearing, chanting, etc. He is the cause of this
extension of this material world. This is already explained by the Lord Himself:
ahaà sarvasya prabhavaù. “I am the origin of everything.”

Therefore to get out of the entanglement of this strong banyan tree of material
life, one must surrender to Kåñëa. As soon as one surrenders unto Kåñëa, he
becomes detached automatically from this material extension.

TRANSLATION
One who is free from illusion, false prestige, and false association, who
understands the eternal, who is done with material lust and is freed from the
duality of happiness and distress, and who knows how to surrender unto the
Supreme Person, attains to that eternal kingdom.

PURPORT
The surrendering process is described here very nicely. The first qualification
is that one should not be deluded by pride. Because the conditioned soul is
puffed up, thinking himself the lord of material nature, it is very difficult
for him to surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One should know by
the cultivation of real knowledge that he is not lord of material nature; the
Supreme Personality of Godhead is the Lord. When one is free from delusion
caused by pride, he can begin the process of surrender. For one who is always
expecting some honor in this material world, it is not possible to surrender to
the Supreme Person. Pride is due to illusion, for although one comes here, stays
for a brief time and then goes away, he has the foolish notion that he is the
lord of the world. He thus makes all things complicated, and he is always in
trouble. The whole world moves under this impression. People are considering
that the land, this earth, belongs to human society, and they have divided the
land under the false impression that they are the proprietors. One has to get
out of this false notion that human society is the proprietor of this world.
When one is freed from such a false notion, he becomes free from all the false
associations caused by familial, social, and national affections. These fake
associations bind one to this material world. After this stage, one has to
develop spiritual knowledge. One has to cultivate knowledge of what is actually
his own and what is actually not his own. And, when one has an understanding of
things as they are, he becomes free from all dual conceptions such as happiness
and distress, pleasure and pain. He becomes full in knowledge; then it is
possible for him to surrender to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

TRANSLATION
That abode of Mine is not illumined by the sun or moon, nor by electricity. One
who reaches it never returns to this material world.

PURPORT
The spiritual world, the abode of the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
Kåñëa—which is known as Kåñëaloka, Goloka Våndävana—is described here. In the
spiritual sky there is no need of sunshine, moonshine, fire or electricity,
because all the planets are self-luminous. We have only one planet in this
universe, the sun, which is self-luminous, but all the planets in the spiritual
sky are self-luminous. The shining effulgence of all those planets (called
Vaikuëöhas) constitutes the shining sky known as the brahmajyoti. Actually, the
effulgence is emanating from the planet of Kåñëa, Goloka Våndävana. Part of that
shining effulgence is covered by the mahat-tattva, the material world. Other
than this, the major portion of that shining sky is full of spiritual planets,
which are called Vaikuëöhas, chief of which is Goloka Våndävana.

As long as a living entity is in this dark material world, he is in conditional
life, but as soon as he reaches the spiritual sky, by cutting through the false,
perverted tree of this material world, he becomes liberated. Then there is no
chance of his coming back here. In his conditional life, the living entity
considers himself to be the lord of this material world, but in his liberated
state he enters into the spiritual kingdom and becomes the associate of the
Supreme Lord. There he enjoys eternal bliss, eternal life, and full knowledge.

One should be captivated by this information. He should desire to transfer
himself to that eternal world and extricate himself from this false reflection
of reality. For one who is too much attached to this material world, it is very
difficult to cut that attachment, but if he takes to Kåñëa consciousness, there
is a chance of gradually becoming detached. One has to associate himself with
devotees, those who are in Kåñëa consciousness. One should search out a society
dedicated to Kåñëa consciousness and learn how to discharge devotional service.
In this way he can cut off his attachment to the material world. One cannot
become detached from the attraction of the material world simply by dressing
himself in saffron cloth. He must become attached to the devotional service of
the Lord. Therefore one should take it very seriously that devotional service as
described in the Twelfth Chapter is the only way to get out of this false
representation of the real tree. In Chapter Fourteen the contamination of all
kinds of processes by material nature is described. Only devotional service is
described as purely transcendental.

The words paramaà mama are very important here. Actually every nook and corner
is the property of the Supreme Lord, but the spiritual world is paramam, full of
six opulences. In the Upaniñads it is also confirmed that in the spiritual world
there is no need of sunshine or moonshine, for the whole spiritual sky is
illuminated by the internal potency of the Supreme Lord. That supreme abode can
be achieved only by surrender and by no other means.

TRANSLATION
The living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal, fragmental parts.
Due to conditioned life, they are struggling very hard with the six senses,
which include the mind.

PURPORT
In this verse the identity of the living being is clearly given. The living
entity is the fragmental part and parcel of the Supreme Lord—eternally. It is
not that he assumes individuality in his conditional life and in his liberated
state becomes one with the Supreme Lord. He is eternally fragmented. It is
clearly said, sanätanaù. According to the Vedic version, the Supreme Lord
manifests and expands Himself in innumerable expansions, of which the primary
expansions are called Viñëu-tattva, and the secondary expansions are called the
living entities. In other words, the Viñëu-tattva is the personal expansion, and
the living entities are separated expansions. By His personal expansion, He is
manifested in various forms like Lord Räma, Nåsiàhadeva, Viñëumürti and all the
predominating Deities in the Vaikuëöha planets. The separated expansions, the
living entities, are eternally servitors. The personal expansions of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, the individual identities of the Godhead, are always
present. Similarly, the separated expansions of living entities have their
identities. As fragmental parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, the living
entities have also fragmental qualities, of which independence is one. Every
living entity has an individual soul, his personal individuality and a minute
form of independence. By misuse of that independence, one becomes a conditioned
soul, and by proper use of independence he is always liberated. In either case,
he is qualititatively eternal, as the Supreme Lord is. In his liberated state he
is freed from this material condition, and he is under the engagement of
transcendental service unto the Lord; in his conditioned life he is dominated by
the material modes of nature, and he forgets the transcendental loving service
of the Lord. As a result, he has to struggle very hard to maintain his existence
in the material world.

The living entities, not only the human beings and the cats and dogs, but even
the greater controllers of the material world—Brahmä, Lord Çiva, and even
Viñëu—are all parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord. They are all eternal, not
temporary manifestations. The word karñati (struggling or grappling hard) is
very significant. The conditioned soul is bound up, as though shackled by iron
chains. He is bound up by the false ego, and the mind is the chief agent which
is driving him in this material existence. When the mind is in the mode of
goodness, his activities are good; when the mind is in the mode of passion, his
activities are troublesome; and when the mind is in the mode of ignorance, he
travels in the lower species of life. It is clear, however, in this verse, that
the conditioned soul is covered by the material body, with the mind and the
senses, and when he is liberated this material covering perishes, but his
spiritual body manifests in its individual capacity. The following information
is there in the Mädhyandi-näyana-çruti: sa vä eña brahma-niñöha idaà saréraà
marttyam atisåjya brahmäbhisampadya brahmaëä paçyati brahmaëä çånoti
brahmaëaivedaà sarvam anubhavati. It is stated here that when a living entity
gives up this material embodiment and enters into the spiritual world, he
revives his spiritual body, and in his spiritual body he can see the Supreme
Personality of Godhead face to face. He can hear and speak to Him face to face,
and he can understand the Supreme Personality as He is. In småti also it is
understood that in the spiritual planets everyone lives in bodies featured like
the Supreme Personality of Godhead’s. As far as bodily construction is
concerned, there is no difference between the part and parcel living entities
and the expansions of Viñëumürti. In other words, at liberation the living
entity gets a spiritual body by the grace of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

The word mamaiväàçaù (fragmental parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord) is also
very significant. The fragmental portion of the Supreme Lord is not like some
material broken part. We have already understood in the Second Chapter that the
spirit cannot be cut into pieces. This fragment is not materially conceived. It
is not like matter which can be cut into pieces and joined together again. That
conception is not applicable here because the Sanskrit word sanätana (eternal)
is used. The fragmental portion is eternal. It is also stated in the beginning
of the Second Chapter that (dehino ’smin yathä) in each and every individual
body, the fragmental portion of the Supreme Lord is present. That fragmental
portion, when liberated from the bodily entanglement, revives its original
spiritual body in the spiritual sky in a spiritual planet and enjoys association
with the Supreme Lord. It is, however, understood here that the living entity,
being the fragmental part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, is qualitatively one,
just as the parts and parcels of gold are also gold.

TRANSLATION
The living entity in the material world carries his different conceptions of
life from one body to another as the air carries aromas.

PURPORT
Here the living entity is described as éçvara, the controller of his own body.
If he likes, he can change his body to a higher grade, and if he likes he can
move to a lower class. Minute independence is there. The change his body
undergoes depends upon him. At the time of death, the consciousness he has
created will carry him on to the next type of body. If he has made his
consciousness like that of a cat or dog, he is sure to change to a cat’s or
dog’s body. And, if he has fixed his consciousness on godly qualities, he will
change into the form of a demigod. And, if he is in Kåñëa consciousness, he will
be transferred to Kåñëaloka in the spiritual world and will associate with
Kåñëa. It is a false claim that after the annihilation of this body everything
is finished. The individual soul is transmigrating from one body to another, and
his present body and present activities are the background of his next body. One
gets a different body according to karma, and he has to quit this body in due
course. It is stated here that the subtle body, which carries the conception of
the next body, develops another body in the next life. This process of
transmigrating from one body to another and struggling while in the body is
called karñati or struggle for existence.

TRANSLATION
The living entity, thus taking another gross body, obtains a certain type of
ear, tongue, and nose and sense of touch, which are grouped about the mind. He
thus enjoys a particular set of sense objects.

PURPORT
In other words, if the living entity adulterates his consciousness with the
qualities of cats and dogs, in his next life he gets a cat or dog body and
enjoys. Consciousness is originally pure, like water. But if we mix water with a
certain color, it changes. Similarly, consciousness is pure, for the spirit soul
is pure. But consciousness is changed according to the association of the
material qualities. Real consciousness is Kåñëa consciousness. When, therefore,
one is situated in Kåñëa consciousness, he is in his pure life. But if his
consciousness is adulterated by some type of material mentality, in the next
life he gets a corresponding body. He does not necessarily get a human body
again; he can get the body of a cat, dog, hog, demigod or one of many other
forms, for there are 8,400,000 species.

TRANSLATION
The foolish cannot understand how a living entity can quit his body, nor can
they understand what sort of body he enjoys under the spell of the modes of
nature. But one whose eyes are trained in knowledge can see all this.

PURPORT
The word jïäna-cakñuñaù is very significant. Without knowledge, one cannot
understand how a living entity leaves his present body, nor what form of body he
is going to take in the next life, nor even why he is living in a particular
type of body. This requires a great amount of knowledge understood from
Bhagavad-gétä and similar literatures heard from a bona fide spiritual master.
One who is trained to perceive all these things is fortunate. Every living
entity is quitting his body under certain circumstances; he is living under
certain circumstances and enjoying under certain circumstances under the spell
of material nature. As a result, he is suffering different kinds of happiness
and distress, under the illusion of sense enjoyment. Persons who are
everlastingly fooled by lust and desire lose all power of understanding their
change of body and their stay in a particular body. They cannot comprehend it.
Those who have developed spiritual knowledge, however, can see that the spirit
is different from the body and is changing its body and enjoying in different
ways. A person in such knowledge can understand how the conditioned living
entity is suffering in this material existence. Therefore those who are highly
developed in Kåñëa consciousness try their best to give this knowledge to the
people in general, for their conditional life is very much troublesome. They
should come out of it and be Kåñëa conscious and liberate themselves to transfer
to the spiritual world.

The endeavoring transcendentalist, who is situated in self-realization, can see
all this clearly. But those who are not situated in self-realization cannot see
what is taking place, though they may try to.

PURPORT
There are many transcendentalists in the path of spiritual self-realization, but
one who is not situated in self-realization cannot see how things are changing
in the body of the living entity. The word yoginaù is significant in this
connection. In the present day there are many so-called yogés, and there are
many so-called associations of yogés, but they are actually blind in the matter
of self-realization. They are simply addicted to some sort of gymnastic exercise
and are satisfied if the body is well-built and healthy. They have no other
information. They are called yatanto ’py akåtätmänaù. Even though they are
endeavoring in a so-called yoga system, they are not self-realized. Such people
cannot understand the process of the transmigration of the soul. Only those who
are actually in the yoga system and have realized the self, the world, and the
Supreme Lord, in other words, the bhakti-yogés, those engaged in pure devotional
service in Krsëa consciousness, can understand how things are taking place.

TRANSLATION
The splendor of the sun, which dissipates the darkness of this whole world,
comes from Me. And the splendor of the moon and the splendor of fire are also
from Me.

PURPORT
The unintelligent cannot understand how things are taking place. The beginning
of knowledge can be established by understanding what the Lord explains here.
Everyone sees the sun, moon, fire and electricity. One should simply try to
understand that the splendor of the sun, the splendor of the moon, and the
splendor of electricity or fire are coming from the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. In such a conception of life, the beginning of Kåñëa consciousness,
lies a great deal of advancement for the conditioned soul in this material
world. The living entities are essentially the parts and parcels of the Supreme
Lord, and He is giving herewith the hint how they can come back to Godhead, back
to home. From this verse we can understand that the sun is illuminating the
whole solar system. There are different universes and solar systems, and there
are different suns, moons and planets also. Sunlight is due to the spiritual
effulgence in the spiritual sky of the Supreme Lord. With the rise of the sun,
the activities of human beings are set up. They set fire to prepare their
foodstuff; they set fire to start the factories, etc. So many things are done
with the help of fire. Therefore sunrise, fire and moonlight are so pleasing to
the living entities. Without their help no living entity can live. So if one can
understand that the light and splendor of the sun, moon and fire are emanating
from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, then one’s Kåñëa consciousness
will begin. By the moonshine, all the vegetables are nourished. The moonshine is
so pleasing that people can easily understand that they are living by the mercy
of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Kåñëa. Without His mercy there cannot be
sun, without His mercy there cannot be moon, and without His mercy there cannot
be fire, and without the help of sun, moon and fire, no one can live. These are
some thoughts to provoke Kåñëa consciousness in the conditioned soul.

TRANSLATION
I enter into each planet, and by My energy they stay in orbit. I become the moon
and thereby supply the juice of life to all vegetables.

PURPORT
It is understood that all the planets are floating in the air only by the energy
of the Lord. The Lord enters into every atom, every planet, and every living
being. That is discussed in the Brahmä-saàhitä. It is said there that one
plenary portion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Paramätmä, enters into
the planets, the universe, the living entity, and even into the atom. So due to
His entrance, everything is appropriately manifested. When the spirit soul is
there, a living man can float on the water, but when the living spark is out of
the body and the body is dead, it sinks. Of course when it is decomposed it
floats just like straw and other things, but as soon as the man is dead, he at
once sinks in the water. Similarly, all these planets are floating in space, and
this is due to the entrance of the supreme energy of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. His energy is sustaining each planet, just like a handful of dust. If
someone holds a handful of dust, there is no possibility of the dust falling,
but if one throws it in the air, it will fall down. Similarly, these planets,
which are floating in air, are actually held in the fist of the universal form
of the Supreme Lord. By His strength and energy, all moving and unmoving things
stay in their place. It is said that because of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, the sun is shining and the planets are steadily moving. Were it not for
Him, all the planets would scatter, like dust in air, and perish. Similarly, it
is due to the Supreme Personality of Godhead that the moon nourishes all
vegetables. Due to the moon’s influence, the vegetables become delicious.
Without the moonshine, the vegetables can neither grow nor taste succulent.
Human society is working, living comfortably and enjoying food due to the supply
from the Supreme Lord. Otherwise, mankind could not survive. The word rasätmakaù
is very significant. Everything becomes palatable by the agency of the Supreme
Lord through the influence of the moon.

TRANSLATION
I am the fire of digestion in every living body, and I am the air of life,
outgoing and incoming, by which I digest the four kinds of foodstuff.

PURPORT
According to Äyur-vedic çästra, we understand that there is a fire in the
stomach which digests all food sent there. When the fire is not blazing, there
is no hunger, and when the fire is in order, we become hungry. Sometimes when
the fire is not going nicely, treatment is required. In any case, this fire is
representative of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Vedic mantras also confirm
that the Supreme Lord or Brahman is situated in the form of fire within the
stomach and is digesting all kinds of foodstuff. Therefore since He is helping
the digestion of all kinds of foodstuff, the living entity is not independant in
the eating process. Unless the Supreme Lord helps him in digesting, there is no
possibility of eating. He thus produces and digests foodstuff, and, by His
grace, we are enjoying life. In the Vedänta-sütra this is also confirmed:
çabdädibhyo ’ntaù pratiñöhänäc ca. The Lord is situated within sound and within
the body, within the air and even within the stomach as the digestive force.
There are four kinds of foodstuff: some are swallowed, some are chewed, some are
licked up, and some are sucked, and He is the digestive force for all of them.

I am seated in everyone’s heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge and
forgetfulness. By all the Vedas am I to be known; indeed I am the compiler of
Vedänta, and I am the knower of the Vedas.

PURPORT
The Supreme Lord is situated as Paramätmä in everyone’s heart, and it is from
Him that all activities are initiated. The living entity forgets everything of
his past life, but he has to act according to the direction of the Supreme Lord,
who is witness to all his work. Therefore he begins his work according to his
past deeds. Required knowledge is supplied to him, and remembrance is given to
him, and he forgets, also, about his past life. Thus, the Lord is not only
all-pervading; He is also localized in every individual heart. He awards the
different fruitive results. He is not only worshipable as the impersonal
Brahman, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the localized Paramätmä, but as
the form of the incarnation of the Vedas as well. The Vedas give the right
direction to the people so that they can properly mold their lives and come back
to Godhead, back to home. The Vedas offer knowledge of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, Kåñëa, and Kåñëa in His incarnation as Vyäsadeva is the compiler of
the Vedänta-sütra. The commentation on the Vedänta-sütra by Vyäsadeva in the
Çrémad-Bhägavatam gives the real understanding of Vedänta-sütra. The Supreme
Lord is so full that for the deliverance of the conditioned soul He is the
supplier and digester of foodstuff, the witness of his activity, the giver of
knowledge in the form of Vedas and as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Çré
Kåñëa, the teacher of the Bhagavad-gétä. He is worshipable by the conditioned
soul. Thus God is all-good; God is all-merciful.

Antaùpraviñöaù çästä janänäm. The living entity forgets as soon as he quits his
present body, but he begins his work again, initiated by the Supreme Lord.
Although he forgets, the Lord gives him the intelligence to renew his work where
he ended his last life. So not only does a living entity enjoy or suffer in this
world according to the dictation from the Supreme Lord situated locally in the
heart, but he receives the opportunity to understand Vedas from Him. If one is
serious to understand the Vedic knowledge, then Kåñëa gives the required
intelligence. Why does He present the Vedic knowledge for understanding? Because
a living entity individually needs to understand Kåñëa. Vedic literature
confirms this: yo ’sau sarvair vedair géyate. In all Vedic literature, beginning
from the four Vedas, Vedänta-sütra and the Upaniñads and Puräëas, the glories of
the Supreme Lord are celebrated. By performing Vedic rituals, discussing the
Vedic philosophy and worshiping the Lord in devotional service, He is attained.
Therefore the purpose of the Vedas is to understand Kåñëa. The Vedas give us
direction to understand Kåñëa and the process of understanding. The ultimate
goal is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Vedänta-sütra confirms this in the
following words: tat tu samanvayät. One can attain perfection by understanding
Vedic literature, and one can understand his relationship with the Supreme
Personality of Godhead by performing the different processes. Thus one can
approach Him and at the end attain the supreme goal, who is no other than the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this verse, however, the purpose of the
Vedas, the understanding of the Vedas and the goal of Vedas are clearly defined.

TRANSLATION
There are two classes of beings, the fallible and the infallible. In the
material world every entity is fallible, and in the spiritual world every entity
is called infallible.

PURPORT
As already explained, the Lord in His incarnation as Vyäsadeva compiled the
Vedänta-sutra. Here the Lord is giving, in summary, the contents of the
Vedänta-sütra: He says that the living entities, who are innumerable, can be
divided into two classes—the fallible and the infallible. The living entities
are eternally separated parts and parcels of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
When they are in contact with the material world, they are called jéva-bhütäù,
and the Sanskrit words given here, sarväëi bhütäni mean that they are fallible.
Those who are in oneness with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, however, are
called infallible. Oneness does not mean that they have no individuality, but
that there is no disunity. They are all agreeable to the purpose of the
creation. Of course, in the spiritual world, there is no such thing as creation,
but since the Supreme Personality of Godhead has stated in the Vedänta-sütra
that He is the source of all emanations, that conception is explained.

According to the statement of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Kåñëa,
there are two classes of men. The Vedas give evidence of this, so there is no
doubt about it. The living entities, who are struggling in this world with the
mind and five senses, have their material bodies which are changing as long as
the living entities are conditioned. One’s body changes due to contact with
matter; matter is changing, so the living entity appears to be changing. But in
the spiritual world the body is not made of matter; therefore there is no
change. In the material world the living entity undergoes six changes—birth,
growth, duration, reproduction, then dwindling and vanishing. These are the
changes of the material body. But in the spiritual world the body does not
change; there is no old age, there is no birth, there is no death. There all
exists in oneness. It is more clearly explained as sarväëi bhütäni: any living
entity who has come in contact with matter, beginning from the first created
being, Brahmä, down to a small ant, is changing its body; therefore they are all
fallible. In the spiritual world, however, they are always liberated in oneness.

TRANSLATION
Besides these two, there is the greatest living personality, the Lord Himself,
who has entered into these worlds and is maintaining them.

PURPORT
This verse is very nicely expressed in the Kaöha Upaniñad and Çvetäçvatara
Upaniñad. It is clearly stated there that above the innumerable living entities,
some of whom are conditioned and some of whom are liberated, there is the
Supreme Personality who is Paramätmä. The Upanisadic verse runs as follows:
nityo nityänäà cetanaç cetanänäm. The purport is that amongst all the living
entities, both conditioned and liberated, there is one supreme living
personality, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who maintains them and gives
them all the facility of enjoyment according to different work. That Supreme
Personality of Godhead is situated in everyone’s heart as Paramätmä. A wise man
who can understand Him is eligible to attain the perfect peace, not others.

It is incorrect to think of the Supreme Lord and the living entities as being on
the same level or equal in all respects. There is always the question of
superiority and inferiority in their personalities. This particular word uttama
is very significant. No one can surpass the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Loke
is also significant because in the Pauruña, a Vedic literature, it is stated:
lokyate vedärtho ’nena. This Supreme Lord in His localized aspect as Paramätmä
explains the purpose of the Vedas. The following verse also appears in the
Vedas:

tävad eña samprasädo ’smäc
charérät samutthäya paraà
jyoti-rüpaà sampadya svena
rüpeëäbhiniñpadyate sa uttamaù puruñaù

“The Supersoul coming out of the body enters the impersonal brahmajyoti; then in
His form He remains in His spiritual identity. That Supreme is called the
Supreme Personality.” This means that the Supreme Personality is exhibiting and
diffusing His spiritual effulgence, which is the ultimate illumination. That
Supreme Personality also has a localized aspect as Paramätmä. By incarnating
Himself as the son of Satyavaté and Paräçara, He explains the Vedic knowledge as
Vyäsadeva.

TRANSLATION
Because I am transcendental, beyond both the fallible and the infallible, and
because I am the greatest, I am celebrated both in the world and in the Vedas as
that Supreme Person.

PURPORT
No one can surpass the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa—neither the
conditioned soul nor the liberated soul. He is, therefore, the greatest of
personalities. Now it is clear here that the living entities and the Supreme
Personality of Godhead are individuals. The difference is that the living
entities, either in the conditioned state or in the liberated state, cannot
surpass in quantity the inconceivable potencies of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead.

TRANSLATION
Whoever knows Me as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, without doubting, is to
be understood as the knower of everything, and he therefore engages himself in
full devotional service, O son of Bharata

PURPORT
There are many philosophical speculations about the constitutional position of
the living entities and the Supreme Absolute Truth. Now in this verse the
Supreme Personality of Godhead clearly explains that anyone who knows Lord Kåñëa
as the Supreme Person is actually the knower of everything. The imperfect knower
goes on simply speculating about the Absolute Truth, but the perfect knower,
without wasting his valuable time, engages directly in Kåñëa consciousness, the
devotional service of the Supreme Lord. Throughout the whole of Bhagavad-gétä,
this fact is being stressed at every step. And still there are so many stubborn
commentators on Bhagavad-gétä who consider the Supreme Absolute Truth and the
living entities to be one and the same.

Vedic knowledge is called çruti learning by aural reception. One should actually
receive the Vedic message from authorities like Kåñëa and His representatives.
Here Kåñëa distinguishes everything very nicely, and one should hear from this
source. Simply to hear like the hogs is not sufficient; one must be able to
understand from the authorities. It is not that one should simply speculate
academically. One should submissively hear from Bhagavad-gétä that these living
entities are always subordinate to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Anyone
who is able to understand this, according to the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
Çré Kåñëa, knows the purpose of the Vedas; no one else knows the purpose of the
Vedas.

The word bhajate is very significant. In many places the word bhajate is
expressed in relationship with the service of the Supreme Lord. If a person is
engaged in full Kåñëa consciousness in devotional service of the Lord, it is to
be understood that he has understood all the Vedic knowledge. In the Vaiñëava
paramparä it is said that if one is engaged in the devotional service of Kåñëa,
then there is no need for a spiritual process to understand the Supreme Absolute
Truth. He has already come to the post because he is engaged in the devotional
service of the Lord. He has ended all preliminary processes of understanding;
similarly, if anyone, after speculating for hundreds of thousands of lives, does
not come to the point that Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and that
one has to surrender there, all his speculation for so many years and lives is a
useless waste of time.

TRANSLATION
This is the most confidential part of the Vedic scriptures, O sinless one, and
it is disclosed now by Me. Whoever understands this will become wise, and his
endeavors will know perfection.

PURPORT
The Lord clearly explains here that this is the substance of all revealed
scriptures. And one should understand this as it is given by the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. Thus one will become intelligent and perfect in
transcendental knowledge. In other words, by understanding this philosophy of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead and engaging in His transcendental service,
everyone can become freed from all contaminations of the modes of material
nature. Devotional service is a process of spiritual understanding. Wherever
devotional service exists, the material contamination cannot coexist. Devotional
service to the Lord and the Lord Himself are one and the same because they are
spiritual—the internal energy of the Supreme Lord. The Lord is said to be the
sun, and ignorance is called darkness. Where the sun is present, there is no
question of darkness. Therefore, whenever devotional service is present under
the proper guidance of a bona fide spiritual master, there is no question of
ignorance.

Everyone must take to this consciousness of Kåñëa and engage in devotional
service to become intelligent and purified. Unless one comes to this position of
understanding Kåñëa and engages in devotional service, however intelligent he
may be in the estimation of some common man, he is not perfectly intelligent.

The word anagha, by which Arjuna is addressed, is significant. Anagha, O sinless
one, means that unless one is free from all sinful reactions, it is very
difficult to understand Kåñëa. One has to become free from all contamination,
all sinful activities; then he can understand. But devotional service is so pure
and potent that once one is engaged in devotional service he automatically comes
to the stage of sinlessness.

While performing devotional service in the association of pure devotees in full
Kåñëa consciousness, there are certain things which require to be vanquished
altogether. The most important thing one has to surmount is weakness of the
heart. The first falldown is caused by the desire to lord it over material
nature. Thus one gives up the transcendental loving service of the Supreme Lord.
The second weakness of the heart is that as one increases the propensity of
lording it over material nature, he becomes attached to matter and the
possession of matter. The problems of material existence are due to these
weaknesses of the heart.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Fifteenth Chapter of the
Çrémad-Bhagavad-gétä in the matter of Puruñottama-yoga, the Yoga of the Supreme
Person.

TRANSLATION
The Blessed Lord said: Fearlessness, purification of one’s existence,
cultivation of spiritual knowledge, charity, self-control, performance of
sacrifice, study of the Vedas, austerity and simplicity; nonviolence,
truthfulness, freedom from anger; renunciation, tranquility, aversion to
faultfinding, compassion and freedom from covetousness; gentleness, modesty and
steady determination; vigor, forgiveness, fortitude, cleanliness, freedom from
envy and the passion for honor—these transcendental qualities, O son of Bharata,
belong to godly men endowed with divine nature.

PURPORT
In the beginning of the Fifteenth Chapter, the banyan tree of this material
world was explained. The extra roots coming out of it were compared to the
activities of the living entities, some auspicious, some inauspicious. In the
Ninth Chapter, also, the devas, or godly, and the asuras, the ungodly, or
demons, were explained. Now, according to Vedic rites, activities in the mode of
goodness are considered auspicious for progress on the path of liberation, and
such activities are known as deva prakåti, transcendental by nature. Those who
are situated in the transcendental nature make progress on the path of
liberation. For those who are acting in the modes of passion and ignorance, on
the other hand, there is no possibility of liberation. Either they will have to
remain in this material world as human beings, or they will descend among the
species of animals or even lower life forms. In this Sixteenth Chapter the Lord
explains both the transcendental nature and its attendant qualities, as well as
the demoniac nature and its qualities. He also explains the advantages and
disadvantages of these qualities.

The word abhijätasya in reference to one born of transcendental qualities or
godly tendencies is very significant. To beget a child in a godly atmosphere is
known in the Vedic scriptures as Garbhädhäna-saàskära. If the parents want a
child in the godly qualities they should follow the ten principles of the human
being. In Bhagavad-gétä we have studied also before that sex life for begetting
a good child is Kåñëa Himself. Sex life is not condemned provided the process is
used in Kåñëa consciousness. Those who are in Kåñëa consciousness at least
should not beget children like cats and dogs but should beget them so they may
become Kåñëa conscious after birth. That should be the advantage of children
born of a father or mother absorbed in Kåñëa consciousness.

The social institution known as varëäçrama-dharma—the institution dividing
society into four divisions or castes—is not meant to divide human society
according to birth. Such divisions are in terms of educational qualifications.
They are to keep the society in a state of peace and prosperity. The qualities
mentioned herein are explained as transcendental qualities meant for making a
person progress in spiritual understanding so he can get liberated from the
material world. In the varëäçrama institution the sannyäsé, or the person in the
renounced order of life, is considered to be the head or the spiritual master of
all the social statuses and orders. A brähmaëa is considered to be the spiritual
master of the three other sections of a society, namely, the kñatriyas, the
vaiçyas and the çüdras, but a sannyäsé, who is on the top of the institution, is
considered to be the spiritual master of the brähmaëas also. For a sannyäsé, the
first qualification should be fearlessness. Because a sannyäsé has to be alone
without any support or guarantee of support, he has simply to depend on the
mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If he thinks, “After leaving my
connections, who will protect me?” he should not accept the renounced order of
life. One must be fully convinced that Kåñëa or the Supreme Personality of
Godhead in His localized aspect as Paramätmä is always within, that He is seeing
everything and He always knows what one intends to do. One must thus have firm
conviction that Kåñëa as Paramätmä will take care of a soul surrendered to Him.
“I shall never be alone,” one should think. “Even if I live in the darkest
regions of a forest I shall be accompanied by Kåñëa, and He will give me all
protection.” That conviction is called abhayam, without fear. This state of mind
is necessary for a person in the renounced order of life. Then he has to purify
his existence. There are so many rules and regulations to be followed in the
renounced order of life. Most important of all, a sannyäsé is strictly forbidden
to have any intimate relationship with a woman. He is even forbidden to talk
with a woman in a secluded place. Lord Caitanya was an ideal sannyäsé, and when
He was at Puré His feminine devotees could not even come near to offer their
respects. They were advised to bow down from a distant place. This is not a sign
of hatred for women as a class, but it is a stricture imposed on the sannyäsé
not to have close connections with women. One has to follow the rules and
regulations of a particular status of life in order to purify his existence. For
a sannyäsé, intimate relations with women and possessions of wealth for sense
gratification are strictly forbidden. The ideal sannyäsé was Lord Caitanya
Himself, and we can learn from His life that He was very strict in regards to
women. Although He is considered to be the most liberal incarnation of Godhead,
accepting the most fallen conditioned souls, He strictly followed the rules and
regulations of the sannyäsa order of the life in connection with association
with woman. One of His personal associates, namely Choöa Haridäsa, was
personally associated with Lord Caitanya, along with His other confidential
personal associates, but somehow or other this Choöa Haridäsa looked lustily on
a young woman, and Lord Caitanya was so strict that He at once rejected him from
the society of His personal associates. Lord Caitanya said, “For a sannyäsé or
anyone who is aspiring to get out of the clutches of material nature and trying
to elevate himself to the spiritual nature and go back to home, back to Godhead,
for him, looking toward material possessions and women for sense
gratification—not even enjoying them, but just looking toward them with such a
propensity—is so condemned that he had better commit suicide before experiencing
such illicit desires.” So these are the processes for purification.

The next item is jïäna-yoga-vyavasthitiù: being engaged in the cultivation of
knowledge. Sannyäsé life is meant for distributing knowledge to the householders
and others who have forgotten their real life of spiritual advancement. A
sannyäsé is supposed to beg from door to door for his livelihood, but this does
not mean that he is a beggar. Humility is also one of the qualifications of a
transcendentally situated person, and out of sheer humility the sannyäsé goes
from door to door, not exactly for the purpose of begging, but to see the
householders and awaken them to Kåñëa consciousness. This is the duty of a
sannyäsé. If he is actually advanced and so ordered by his spiritual master, he
should preach Kåñëa with logic and understanding, and if he is not so advanced
he should not accept the renounced order of life. But even if he has accepted
the renounced order of life without sufficient knowledge, he should engage
himself fully in hearing from a bona fide spiritual master to cultivate
knowledge. A sannyäsé or one in the renounced order of life must be situated in
fearlessness, sattva-saàçuddhiù (purity) and jïäna-yoga (knowledge).

The next item is charity. Charity is meant for the householders. The
householders should earn a livelihood by an honorable means and spend fifty
percent of their income to propagate Kåñëa consciousness all over the world.
Thus a householder should give in charity to such institutional societies that
are engaged in that way. Charity should be given to the right receiver. There
are different kinds of charities, as will be explained later on, charity in the
modes of goodness, passion and ignorance. Charity in the mode of goodness is
recommended by the scriptures, but charity in the modes of passion and ignorance
is not recommended because it is simply a waste of money. Charity should be
given only to propagate Kåsna consciousness all over the world. That is charity
in the mode of goodness.

Then as far as damaù (self-control) is concerned, it is not only meant for other
orders of religious society, but it is especially meant for the householder.
Although he has a wife, a householder should not use his senses for sex life
unnecessarily. There are restrictions for the householders even in sex life,
which should only be engaged in for the propagation of children. If he does not
require children, he should not enjoy sex life with his wife. Modern society
enjoys sex life with contraceptive methods or more abominable methods to avoid
the responsibility of children. This is not in the transcendental quality but is
demoniac. If anyone, even if he is a householder, wants to make progress in
spiritual life, he must control his sex life and should not beget a child
without the purpose of serving Kåñëa. If he is able to beget children who will
be in Kåñëa consciousness, one can produce hundreds of children, but without
this capacity one should not indulge only for sense pleasure.

Sacrifice is another item to be performed by the householders because sacrifices
require a large amount of money. Other orders of life, namely the brahmacarya,
the vänaprastha and sannyäsa, have no money; they live by begging. So
performance of different types of sacrifice is meant for the householder. They
should perform agni-hotra sacrifices as enjoined in the Vedic literature, but
such sacrifices at the present moment are very expensive, and it is not possible
for any householder to perform them. The best sacrifice recommended in this age
is called saìkértana-yajïa, the chanting of Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa,
Hare Hare/Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare. This is the best and most
inexpensive sacrifice; everyone can adopt it and derive benefit. So these three
items, namely charity, sense control and performance of sacrifice, are meant for
the householder.

Then svädhyäyaù, Vedic study, and tapas, austerity, and ärjavam, gentleness or
simplicity, are meant for the brahmacarya or student life. Brahmacärés should
have no connection with women; they should live a life of celibacy and engage
the mind in the study of Vedic literature for cultivation of spiritual
knowledge. This is called svädhyäyaù. Tapas or austerity is especially meant for
the retired life. One should not remain a householder throughout his whole life;
he must always remember that there are four divisions of life, brahmacarya,
gåhastha, vänaprastha and sannyäsa. So after gåhastha, householder life, one
should retire. If one lives for a hundred years, he should spend twenty-five
years in student life, twenty-five in householder life, twenty-five in retired
life and twenty-five in the renounced order of life. These are the regulations
of the Vedic religious discipline. A man retired from household life must
practice austerities of the body, mind and tongue. That is tapasyä. The entire
varëäçrama-dharma society is meant for tapasyä. Without tapasyä or austerity no
human being can get liberation. The theory that there is no need of austerity in
life, that one can go on speculating and everything will be nice, is neither
recommended in the Vedic literature nor in Bhagavad-gétä. Such theories are
manufactured by showbottle spiritualists who are trying to gather more
followers. If there are restrictions, rules and regulations, people will not
become attracted. Therefore those who want followers in the name of religion,
just to have a show only, don’t restrict the lives of their students nor their
own lives. But that method is not approved by the Vedas.

As far as simplicity is concerned, not only should a particular order of life
follow this principle, but every member, be he in the brahmacarya-äçrama, or
gåhastha-äçrama or vänaprastha-äçrama. One must live very simply.

Ahiàsä means not arresting the progressive life of any living entity. One should
not think that since the spirit spark is never killed even after the killing of
the body there is no harm in killing animals for sense gratification. People are
now addicted to eating animals, in spite of having an ample supply of grains,
fruits and milk. There is no necessity for animal killing. This injunction is
for everyone. When there is no other alternative, one may kill an animal, but it
should be offered in sacrifice. At any rate, when there is an ample food supply
for humanity, persons who are desiring to make advancement in spiritual
realization should not commit violence to animals. Real ahiàsä means not
checking anyone’s progressive life. The animals are also making progress in
their evolutionary life by transmigrating from one category of animal life to
another. If a particular animal is killed, then his progress is checked. If an
animal is staying in a particular body for so many days or so many years and is
untimely killed, then he has to come back again in that form of life to complete
the remaining days in order to be promoted to another species of life. So their
progress should not be checked simply to satisfy one’s palate. This is called
ahiàsä.

Satyam. This word means that one should not distort the truth for some personal
interest. In Vedic literature there are some difficult passages, but the meaning
or the purpose should be learned from a bona fide spiritual master. That is the
process for understanding Vedas. Çruti means that one should hear from the
authority. One should not construe some interpretation for his personal
interest. There are so many commentaries on Bhagavad-gétä that misinterpret the
original text. The real import of the word should be presented, and that should
be learned from a bona fide spiritual master.

Akrodhaù means to check anger. Even if there is provocation one should be
tolerant, for once one becomes angry his whole body becomes polluted. Anger is
the product of the modes of passion and lust, so one who is transcendentally
situated should check himself from anger. Apaiçunam means that one should not
find fault with others or correct them unnecessarily. Of course to call a thief
a thief is not faultfinding, but to call an honest person a thief is very much
offensive for one who is making advancement in spiritual life. Hréù means that
one should be very modest and must not perform some act which is abominable.
Acäpalam, determination, means that one should not be agitated or frustrated in
some attempt. There may be failure in some attempt, but one should not be sorry
for that; he should make progress with patience and determination. The word
tejaù used here is meant for the kñatriyas. The kñatriyas should always be very
strong to be able to give protection to the weak. They should not pose
themselves as nonviolent. If violence is required, they must exhibit it.

Çaucam means cleanliness, not only in mind and body but in one’s dealings also.
It is especially meant for the mercantile people, who should not deal in the
black market. Nätimänitä, not expecting honor, applies to the çüdras, the worker
class, which are considered, according to Vedic injunctions, to be the lowest of
the four classes. They should not be puffed up with unnecessary prestige or
honor and should remain in their own status. It is the duty of the çüdras to
offer respect to the higher class for the upkeep of the social order.

All these sixteen qualifications mentioned are transcendental qualities. They
should be cultivated according to the different statuses of the social order.
The purport is that even though material conditions are miserable, if these
qualities are developed by practice, by all classes of men, then gradually it is
possible to rise to the highest platform of transcendental realization.

TRANSLATION
Arrogance, pride, anger, conceit, harshness and ignorance—these qualities belong
to those of demonic nature, O son of Påthä.

PURPORT
In this verse, the royal road to hell is described. The demoniac want to make a
show of religion and advancement in spiritual science, although they do not
follow the principles. They are always arrogant or proud in possessing some type
of education or so much wealth. They desire to be worshiped by others, and
demand respectability, although they do not command respect. Over trifles they
become very angry and speak harshly, not gently. They do not know what should be
done and what should not be done. They do everything whimsically, according to
their own desire, and they do not recognize any authority. These demoniac
qualities are taken on by them from the beginning of their bodies in the wombs
of their mothers, and as they grow they manifest all these inauspicious
qualities.

TRANSLATION
The transcendental qualities are conducive to liberation, whereas the demonic
qualities make for bondage. Do not worry, O son of Päëòu, for you are born with
the divine qualities.

PURPORT
Lord Kåñëa encouraged Arjuna by telling him that he was not born with demoniac
qualities. His involvement in the fight was not demoniac because he was
considering the pro’s and con’s. He was considering whether respectable persons
such as Bhéñma and Droëa should be killed or not, so he was not acting under the
influence of anger, false prestige, or harshness. Therefore he was not of the
quality of the demons. For a kñatriya, a military man, shooting arrows at the
enemy is considered transcendental, and refraining from such a duty is demoniac.
Therefore, there was no cause for Arjuna to lament. Anyone who performs the
regulated principles of the different orders of life is transcendentally
situated.

O son of Påthä, in this world there are two kinds of created beings. One is
called the divine and the other demonic. I have already explained to you at
length the divine qualities. Now hear from Me of the demoniac.

PURPORT
Lord Kåñëa, having assured Arjuna that he was born with the divine qualities, is
now describing the demoniac way. The conditioned living entities are divided
into two classes in this world. Those who are born with divine qualities follow
a regulated life; that is to say they abide by the injunctions in scriptures and
by the authorities. One should perform duties in the light of authoritative
scripture. This mentality is called divine. One who does not follow the
regulative principles as they are laid down in the scriptures and who acts
according to his whims is called demoniac or asuric. There is no other criterion
but obedience to the regulative principles of scriptures. It is mentioned in
Vedic literature that both the demigods and the demons are born of the
Prajäpati; the only difference is that one class obeys the Vedic injunctions and
the other does not.

TRANSLATION
Those who are demoniac do not know what is to be done and what is not to be
done. Neither cleanliness nor proper behavior nor truth is found in them.

PURPORT
In every civilized human society there is some set of scriptural rules and
regulations which are followed from the beginning, especially among the Äryans,
those who adopt the Vedic civilization and who are known as the most advanced
civilized peoples. Those who do not follow the scriptural injunctions are
supposed to be demons. Therefore it is stated here that the demons do not know
the scriptural rules, nor do they have any inclination to follow them. Most of
them do not know them, and even if some of them know, they have not the tendency
to follow them. They have no faith, nor are they willing to act in terms of the
Vedic injunctions. The demons are not clean, either externally or internally.

One should always be careful to keep his body clean by bathing, brushing teeth,
changing clothes, etc. As far as internal cleanliness is concerned, one should
always remember the holy names of God and chant Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa
Kåñëa, Hare Hare/Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare. The demons neither
like nor follow all these rules for external and internal cleanliness.

As for behavior, there are many rules and regulations guiding human behavior,
such as the Manu-saàhitä, which is the law of the human race. Even up to today,
those who are Hindu follow the Manu-saàhitä. Laws of inheritance and other
legalities are derived from this book. Now, in the Manu-saàhitä, it is clearly
stated that a woman should not be given freedom. That does not mean that women
are to be kept as slaves, but they are like children. Children are not given
freedom, but that does not mean that they are kept as slaves. The demons have
now neglected such injunctions, and they think that women should be given as
much freedom as men. However, this has not improved the social condition of the
world. Actually, a woman should be given protection at every stage of life. She
should be given protection by the father in her younger days, by the husband in
her youth, and by the grownup sons in her old age. This is proper social
behavior according to the Manu-saàhitä. But modern education has artificially
devised a puffed up concept of womanly life, and therefore marriage is
practically now an imagination in human society. Nor is the moral condition of
woman very good now. The demons, therefore, do not accept any instruction which
is good for society, and because they do not follow the experience of great
sages and the rules and regulations laid down by the sages, the social condition
of the demoniac people is very miserable.

lust; sambhütam—caused; kim anyat—there is no other cause; käma-haitukam—it is
due to lust only.

TRANSLATION
They say that this world is unreal, that there is no foundation and that there
is no God in control. It is produced of sex desire, and has no cause other than
lust.

PURPORT
The demoniac conclude that the world is phantasmagoria. There is no cause, no
effect, no controller, no purpose: everything is unreal. They say that this
cosmic manifestation arises due to chance material actions and reactions. They
do not think that the world was created by God for a certain purpose. They have
their own theory: that the world has come about in its own way and that there is
no reason to believe that there is a God behind it. For them there is no
difference between spirit and matter, and they do not accept the Supreme Spirit.
Everything is matter only, and the whole cosmos is supposed to be a mass of
ignorance. According to them, everything is void, and whatever manifestation
exists is due to our ignorance in perception. They take it for granted that all
manifestation of diversity is a display of ignorance. Just as in a dream we may
create so many things, which actually have no existence, so when we are awake we
shall see that everything is simply a dream. But factually, although the demons
say that life is a dream, they are very expert in enjoying this dream. And so,
instead of acquiring knowledge, they become more and more implicated in their
dreamland. They conclude that as a child is simply the result of sexual
intercourse between man and woman, this world is born without any soul. For them
it is only a combination of matter that has produced the living entities, and
there is no question of the existence of the soul. As many living creatures come
out from perspiration and from a dead body without any cause, similarly, the
whole living world has come out of the material combinations of the cosmic
manifestation. Therefore material nature is the cause of this manifestation, and
there is no other cause. They do not believe in the words of Kåñëa in
Bhagavad-gétä: mayädhyakñeëa prakåtiù süyate sa-caräcaram. “Under My direction
the whole material world is moving.” In other words, amongst the demons there is
no perfect knowledge of the creation of this world; every one of them has some
particular theory of his own. According to them, one interpretation of the
scriptures is as good as another, for they do not believe in a standard
understanding of the scriptural injunctions.

TRANSLATION
Following such conclusions, the demoniac, who are lost to themselves and who
have no intelligence, engage in unbeneficial, horrible works meant to destroy
the world.

PURPORT
The demoniac are engaged in activities that will lead the world to destruction.
The Lord states here that they are less intelligent. The materialists, who have
no concept of God, think that they are advancing. But, according to
Bhagavad-gétä, they are unintelligent and devoid of all sense. They try to enjoy
this material world to the utmost limit and therefore always engage in inventing
something for sense gratification. Such materialistic inventions are considered
to be advancement of human civilization, but the result is that people grow more
and more violent and more and more cruel, cruel to animals and cruel to other
human beings. They have no idea how to behave toward one another. Animal killing
is very prominent amongst demoniac people. Such people are considered the
enemies of the world because ultimately they will invent or create something
which will bring destruction to all. Indirectly, this verse anticipates the
invention of nuclear weapons, of which the whole world is today very proud. At
any moment war may take place, and these atomic weapons may create havoc. Such
things are created solely for the destruction of the world, and this is
indicated here. Due to godlessness, such weapons are invented in human society;
they are not meant for the peace and prosperity of the world.

TRANSLATION
The demoniac, taking shelter of insatiable lust, pride and false prestige, and
being thus illusioned, are always sworn to unclean work, attracted by the
impermanent.

PURPORT
The demoniac mentality is described here. The demons’ lust is never satiated.
They will go on increasing and increasing their insatiable desires for material
enjoyment. Although they are always full of anxieties on account of accepting
nonpermanent things, they still continue to engage in such activities out of
illusion. They have no knowledge and cannot tell that they are heading the wrong
way. Accepting nonpermanent things, such demoniac people create their own God,
create their own hymns and chant accordingly. The result is that they become
more and more attracted to two things—sex enjoyment and accumulation of material
wealth. The word açuci-vratäù, unclean vow, is very significant in this
connection. Such demoniac people are only attracted by wine, women, gambling and
meat eating; those are their açuci, unclean habits. Induced by pride and false
prestige, they create some principles of religion which are not approved by the
Vedic injunctions. Although such demoniac people are most abominable in the
world, still, by artificial means, the world creates a false honor for them.
Although they are gliding toward hell, they consider themselves very much
advanced.

TRANSLATION
They believe that to gratify the senses unto the end of life is the prime
necessity of human civilization. Thus there is no end to their anxiety. Being
bound by hundreds and thousands of desires, by lust and anger, they secure money
by illegal means for sense gratification.

PURPORT
The demoniac accept that the enjoyment of the senses is the ultimate goal of
life, and this concept they maintain until death. They do not believe in life
after death, and they do not believe that one takes on different types of bodies
according to one’s karma, or activities in this world. Their plans for life are
never finished, and they go on preparing plan after plan, all of which are never
finished. We have personal experience of a person of such demoniac mentality,
who, even at the point of death, was requesting the physician to prolong his
life for four years more because his plans were not yet complete. Such foolish
people do not know that a physician cannot prolong life even for a moment. When
the notice is there, there is no consideration of the man’s desire. The laws of
nature do not allow a second beyond what one is destined to enjoy.

The demoniac person, who has no faith in God or the Supersoul within himself,
performs all kinds of sinful activities simply for sense gratification. He does
not know that there is a witness sitting within his heart. The Supersoul is
observing the activities of the individual soul. As it is stated in the Vedic
literature, the Upaniñads, there are two birds sitting in one tree; the one is
acting and enjoying or suffering the fruits of the branches, and the other is
witnessing. But one who is demoniac has no knowledge of Vedic scripture, nor has
he any faith; therefore he feels free to do anything for sense enjoyment,
regardless of the consequences.

future, more and more. He is my enemy, and I have killed him; and my other enemy
will also be killed. I am the lord of everything, I am the enjoyer, I am
perfect, powerful and happy. I am the richest man, surrounded by aristocratic
relatives. There is none so powerful and happy as I am. I shall perform
sacrifices, I shall give some charity, and thus I shall rejoice.” In this way,
such persons are deluded by ignorance.

TRANSLATION
Thus perplexed by various anxieties and bound by a network of illusions, one
becomes too strongly attached to sense enjoyment and falls down into hell.

PURPORT
The demoniac man knows no limit to his desire to acquire money. That is
unlimited. He only thinks how much assessment he has just now and schemes to
engage that stock of wealth farther and farther. For that reason, he does not
hesitate to act in any sinful way and so deals in the black market for illegal
gratification. He is enamoured by the possessions he has already, such as land,
family, house and bank balance, and he is always planning to improve them. He
believes in his own strength, and he does not know that whatever he is gaining
is due to his past good deeds. He is given an opportunity to accumulate such
things, but he has no conception of past causes. He simply thinks that all his
mass of wealth is due to his own endeavor. A demoniac person believes in the
strength of his personal work, not in the law of karma. According to the law of
karma, a man takes his birth in a high family, or becomes rich, or very well
educated, or very beautiful because of good work in the past. The demoniac
thinks that all these things are accidental and due to the strength of his
personal ability. He does not sense any arrangement behind all the varieties of
people, beauty, and education. Anyone who comes into competition with such a
demoniac man is his enemy. There are many demoniac people, and each is enemy to
the others. This enmity becomes more and more deep—between persons, then between
families, then between societies, and at last between nations. Therefore there
is constant strife, war and enmity all over the world.

Each demoniac person thinks that he can live at the sacrifice of all others.
Generally, a demoniac person thinks of himself as the Supreme God, and a
demoniac preacher tells his followers: “Why are you seeking God elsewhere? You
are all yourselves God! Whatever you like, you can do. Don’t believe in God.
Throw away God. God is dead.” These are the demoniac’s preachings.

Although the demoniac person sees others equally rich and influential, or even
more so, he thinks that no one is richer than him and that no one is more
influential than him. As far as promotion to the higher planetary system is
concerned, he does not believe in performing yajïas or sacrifices. Demons think
that they will manufacture their own process of yajïa and prepare some machine,
by which they will be able to reach any higher planet. The best example of such
a demoniac man was Rävaëa. He offered a program to the people by which he would
prepare a staircase so that anyone could reach the heavenly planets without
performing sacrifices, such as are prescribed in the Vedas. Similarly, in the
present age such demoniac men are striving to reach the higher planetary systems
by mechanical arrangement. These are examples of bewilderment. The result is
that, without their knowledge, they are gliding toward hell. Here the Sanskrit
word mohajäla is very significant. Jäla means net; like fishes caught in a net,
they have no way to come out.

TRANSLATION
Self-complacent and always impudent, deluded by wealth and false prestige, they
sometimes perform sacrifices in name only without following any rules or
regulations.

PURPORT
Thinking themselves all in all, not caring for any authority or scripture, the
demoniac sometimes perform so-called religious or sacrificial rites. And since
they do not believe in authority, they are very impudent. This is due to
illusion caused by accumulating some wealth and false prestige. Sometimes such
demons take up the role of preacher, mislead the people, and become known as
religious reformers or as incarnations of God. They make a show of performing
sacrifices, or they worship the demigods, or manufacture their own God. Common
men advertise them as God and worship them, and by the foolish they are
considered advanced in the principles of religion, or in the principles of
spiritual knowledge. They take the dress of the renounced order of life and
engage in all nonsense in that dress. Actually there are so many restrictions
for one who has renounced this world. The demons, however, do not care for such
restrictions. They think that whatever path one can create is one’s own path;
there is no such thing as a standard path one has to follow. The word
avidhi-pürvakam, meaning disregard for the rules and regulations, is especially
stressed here. These things are always due to ignorance and illusion.

Bewildered by false ego, strength, pride, lust and anger, the demon becomes

PURPORT
A demoniac person, being always against God’s supremacy, does not like to
believe in the scriptures. He is envious of both the scriptures and of the
existence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is caused by his so-called
prestige and his accumulation of wealth and strength. He does not know that the
present life is a preparation for the next life. Not knowing this, he is
actually envious of his own self, as well as of others. He commits violence on
other bodies and on his own. He does not care for the supreme control of the
Personality of Godhead because he has no knowledge. Being envious of the
scriptures and the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he puts forward false
arguments against the existence of God and refutes the scriptural authority. He
thinks himself independant and powerful in every action. He thinks that since no
one can equal him in strength, power, or in wealth, he can act in any way and no
one can stop him. If he has an enemy who might check the advancement of his
sensual activities, he makes plans to cut him down by his own power.

TRANSLATION
Those who are envious and mischievous, who are the lowest among men, are cast by
Me into the ocean of material existence, into various demoniac species of life.

PURPORT
In this verse it is clearly indicated that the placing of a particular
individual soul in a particular body is the prerogative of the supreme will. The
demoniac person may not agree to accept the supremacy of the Lord, and it is a
fact that he may act according to his own whims, but his next birth will depend
upon the decision of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and not on himself. In
the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, Third Canto, it is stated that an individual soul, after
his death, is put into the womb of a mother where he gets a particular type of
body under the supervision of superior power. Therefore in the material
existence we find so many species of life—animals, insects, men, and so on. All
are arranged by the superior power. They are not accidental. As for the
demoniac, it is clearly said here that they are perpetually put into the wombs
of demons, and thus they continue to be envious, the lowest of mankind. Such
demoniac species of life are held to be always full of lust, always violent and
hateful and always unclean. They are just like so many beasts in a jungle.

TRANSLATION
Attaining repeated birth amongst the species of demoniac life, such persons can
never approach Me. Gradually they sink down to the most abominable type of
existence.

PURPORT
It is known that God is all-merciful, but here we find that God is never
merciful to the demoniac. It is clearly stated that the demoniac people, life
after life, are put into the wombs of similar demons, and, not achieving the
mercy of the Supreme Lord, they go down and down, so that at last they achieve
bodies like those of cats, dogs and hogs. It is clearly stated that such demons
have practically no chance of receiving the mercy of God at any stage of later
life. In the Vedas also it is stated that such persons gradually sink to become
dogs and hogs. It may be then argued in this connection that God should not be
advertised as all-merciful if He is not merciful to such demons. In answer to
this question, in the Vedänta-sütra we find that the Supreme Lord has no hatred
for anyone. The placing of the asuras, the demons, in the lowest status of life
is simply another feature of His mercy. Sometimes the asuras are killed by the
Supreme Lord, but this killing is also good for them, for in Vedic literature we
find that anyone who is killed by the Supreme Lord becomes liberated. There are
instances in history of many asuras—Rävaëa, Kaàsa, Hiraëyakaçipu—to whom the
Lord appeared in various incarnations just to kill. Therefore God’s mercy is
shown to the asuras if they are fortunate enough to be killed by Him.

There are three gates leading to this hell—lust, anger, and greed. Every sane
man should give these up, for they lead to the degradation of the soul.

PURPORT
The beginning of demoniac life is described herein. One tries to satisfy his
lust, and when he cannot, anger and greed arise. A sane man who does not want to
glide down to the species of demoniac life must try to give up these three
enemies which can kill the self to such an extent that there will be no
possibility of liberation from this material entanglement.

TRANSLATION
The man who has escaped these three gates of hell, O son of Kunté, performs acts
conducive to self-realization and thus gradually attains the supreme
destination.

PURPORT
One should be very careful of these three enemies to human life: lust, anger,
and greed. The more a person is freed from lust, anger and greed, the more his
existence becomes pure. Then he can follow the rules and regulations enjoined in
the Vedic literature. By following the regulative principles of human life, one
gradually raises himself to the platform of spiritual realization. If one is so
fortunate, by such practice, to rise to the platform of Kåñëa consciousness,
then success is guaranteed for him. In the Vedic literature, the ways of action
and reaction are prescribed to enable one to come to the stage of purification.
The whole method is based on giving up lust, greed and anger. By cultivating
knowledge of this process, one can be elevated to the highest position of
self-realization; this self-realization is perfected in devotional service. In
that devotional service, the liberation of the conditioned soul is guaranteed.
Therefore, according to the Vedic system, there are instituted the four orders
of life and the four statuses of life, called the caste system and the spiritual
order system. There are different rules and regulations for different castes or
divisions of society, and if a person is able to follow them, he will be
automatically raised to the highest platform of spiritual realization. Then he
can have liberation without a doubt.

TRANSLATION
But he who discards scriptural injunctions and acts according to his own whims
attains neither perfection, nor happiness, nor the supreme destination.

PURPORT
As described before, the çästra-vidhim, or the direction of the çästra, is given
to the different castes and orders of human society. Everyone is expected to
follow these rules and regulations. If one does not follow them and acts
whimsically according to his lust, greed and desire, then he never will be
perfect in his life. In other words, a man may theoretically know all these
things, but if he does not apply them in his own life, then he is to be known as
the lowest of mankind. In the human form of life, a living entity is expected to
be sane and to follow the regulations given for elevating his life to the
highest platform, but if he does not follow them, then he degrades himself. But
even if he follows the rules and regulations and moral principles and ultimately
does not come to the stage of understanding the Supreme Lord, then all his
knowledge becomes spoiled. Therefore one should gradually raise himself to the
platform of Kåñëa consciousness and devotional service; it is then and there
that he can attain the highest perfectional stage, not otherwise.

The word käma-cärataù is very significant. A person who knowingly violates the
rules acts in lust. He knows that this is forbidden, still he acts. This is
called acting whimsically. He knows that this should be done, but still he does
not do it; therefore he is called whimsical. Such persons are destined to be
condemned by the Supreme Lord. Such persons cannot have the perfection which is
meant for the human life. The human life is especially meant for purifying one’s
existence, and one who does not follow the rules and regulations cannot purify
himself, nor can he attain the real stage of happiness.

TRANSLATION
One should understand what is duty and what is not duty by the regulations of
the scriptures. Knowing such rules and regulations, one should act so that he
may gradually be elevated.

PURPORT
As stated in the Fifteenth Chapter, all the rules and regulations of the Vedas
are meant for knowing Kåñëa. If one understands Krsëa from the Bhagavad-gétä and
becomes situated in Krsëa consciousness, engaging himself in devotional service,
he has reached the highest perfection of knowledge offered by the Vedic
literature. Lord Caitanya Mahäprabhu made this process very easy: He asked
people simply to chant Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare
Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare and to engage in the devotional service of
the Lord and eat the remnants of foodstuff offered to the Deity. One who is
directly engaged in all these devotional activities is to be understood as
having studied all Vedic literature. He has come to the conclusion perfectly. Of
course, for the ordinary persons who are not in Krsëa consciousness or who are
not engaged in devotional service, what is to be done and what is not to be done
must be decided by the injunctions of the Vedas. One should act accordingly,
without argument. That is called following the principles of çästra, or
scripture. Çästra is without the four principal defects that are visible in the
conditioned soul: imperfect senses, the propensity for cheating, certainty of
committing mistakes, and certainty of being illusioned. These four principal
defects in conditioned life disqualify one from putting forth rules and
regulations. Therefore, the rules and regulations as described in the
çästra—being above these defects—are accepted without alteration by all great
saints, äcäryas, and great souls.

In India there are many parties of spiritual understanding, generally classified
as two: the impersonalist and the personalist. Both of them, however, lead their
lives according to the principles of the Vedas. Without following the principles
of the scriptures, one cannot elevate himself to the perfectional stage. One who
actually, therefore, understands the purport of the çästras is considered
fortunate.

In human society, aversion to the principles of understanding the Supreme
Personality of Godhead is the cause of all falldowns. That is the greatest
offense of human life. Therefore, mäyä, the material energy of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, is always giving us trouble in the shape of the
threefold miseries. This material energy is constituted of the three modes of
material nature. One has to raise himself at least to the mode of goodness
before the path to understanding the Supreme Lord can be opened. Without raising
oneself to the standard of the mode of goodness, one remains in ignorance and
passion, which are the cause of demoniac life. Those in the modes of passion and
ignorance deride the scriptures, deride the holy man, and deride the proper
understanding of the spiritual master, and they do not care for the regulations
of the scriptures. In spite of hearing the glories of devotional service, they
are not attracted. Thus they manufacture their own way of elevation. These are
some of the defects of human society, which lead to the demoniac status of life.
If, however, one is able to be guided by a proper and bona fide spiritual
master, who can lead one to the path of elevation, to the higher stage, then
one’s life becomes successful.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Sixteenth Chapter of the
Çrémad-Bhagavad-gétä in the matter of the Divine and Demoniac Natures.

The Divisions of Faith

TRANSLATION
Arjuna said, O Kåñëa, what is the situation of one who does not follow the
principles of scripture but worships according to his own imagination? Is he in
goodness, in passion or in ignorance?

PURPORT
In the Fourth Chapter, thirty-ninth verse, it is said that a person faithful to
a particular type of worship gradually becomes elevated to the stage of
knowledge and attains the highest perfectional stage of peace and prosperity. In
the Sixteenth Chapter, it is concluded that one who does not follow the
principles laid down in the scriptures is called an asura, demon, and one who
follows the scriptural injunctions faithfully is called a deva, or demigod. Now,
if one, with faith, follows some rules which are not mentioned in the scriptural
injunctions, what is his position? This doubt of Arjuna is to be cleared by
Kåñëa. Are those who create some sort of God by selecting a human being and
placing their faith in him worshiping in goodness, passion or ignorance? Do such
persons attain the perfectional stage of life? Is it possible for them to be
situated in real knowledge and elevate themselves to the highest perfectional
stage? Do those who do not follow the rules and regulations of the scriptures
but who have faith in something and worship gods and demigods and men attain
success in their effort? Arjuna is putting these questions to Kåñëa.

TRANSLATION
The Supreme Lord said, according to the modes of nature acquired by the embodied
soul, one’s faith can be of three kinds—goodness, passion or ignorance. Now hear
about these.

PURPORT
Those who know the rules and regulations of the scriptures, but, out of laziness
or indolence, give up following these rules and regulations, are governed by the
modes of material nature. According to their previous activities in the modes of
goodness, passion or ignorance, they acquire a nature which is of a specific
quality. The association of the living entity with the different modes of nature
has been going on perpetually since the living entity is in contact with
material nature. Thus he acquires different types of mentality according to his
association with the material modes. But this nature can be changed if one
associates with a bona fide spiritual master and abides by his rules and the
scriptures. Gradually, one can change his position from ignorance to goodness,
or from passion to goodness. The conclusion is that blind faith in a particular
mode of nature cannot help a person become elevated to the perfectional stage.
One has to consider things carefully, with intelligence, in the association of a
bona fide spiritual master. Thus one can change his position to a higher mode of
nature.

TRANSLATION
According to one’s existence under the various modes of nature, one evolves a
particular kind of faith. The living being is said to be of a particular faith
according to the modes he has acquired.

PURPORT
Everyone has a particular type of faith, regardless of what he is. But his faith
is considered good, passionate or ignorant according to the nature he has
acquired. Thus, according to his particular type of faith, one associates with
certain persons. Now the real fact is that every living being, as is stated in
the Fifteenth Chapter, is originally the fragmental part and parcel of the
Supreme Lord. Therefore one is originally transcendental to all the modes of
material nature. But when one forgets his relationship with the Supreme
Personality of Godhead and comes into contact with the material nature in
conditional life, he generates his own position by association with the
different varieties of material nature. The resultant artificial faith and
existence are only material. Although one may be conducted by some impression,
or some conception of life, still, originally, he is nirguëa, or transcendental.
Therefore one has to become cleansed of the material contamination that he has
acquired in order to regain his relationship with the Supreme Lord. That is the
only path back without fear: Kåñëa consciousness. If one is situated in Kåñëa
consciousness, then that path is guaranteed for his elevation to the
perfectional stage. If one does not take to this path of self-realization, then
he is surely to be conducted by the influence of the modes of nature.

The word sattva, or faith, is very significant in this verse. Sattva or faith
always comes out of the works of goodness. One’s faith may be in a demigod or
some created God or some mental concoction. It is supposed to be one’s strong
faith in something that is productive of the works of material goodness. But in
material conditional life, no works of material nature are completely purified.
They are mixed. They are not in pure goodness. Pure goodness is transcendental;
in purified goodness one can understand the real nature of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. As long as one’s faith is not completely in purified
goodness, the faith is subject to contamination by any of the modes of material
nature. The contaminated modes of material nature expand to the heart. Therefore
according to the position of the heart in contact with a particular mode of
material nature, one’s faith is established. It should be understood, that if
one’s heart is in the mode of goodness, his faith is also in the mode of
goodness. If his heart is in the mode of passion, his faith is also in the mode
of passion. And if his heart is in the mode of darkness, illusion, his faith is
also thus contaminated. Thus we find different types of faith in this world, and
there are different types of religions due to different types of faith. The real
principle of religious faith is situated in the mode of pure goodness, but
because the heart is tainted, we find different types of religious principles.
Thus according to different types of faith, there are different kinds of
worship.

TRANSLATION
Men in the mode of goodness worship the demigods; those in the mode of passion
worship the demons; and those in the mode of ignorance worship ghosts and
spirits.

PURPORT
In this verse the Supreme Personality of Godhead describes different kinds of
worshipers according to their external activities. According to scriptural
injunction, only the Supreme Personality of Godhead is worshipable, but those
who are not very conversant with, or faithful to, the scriptural injunctions
worship different objects, according to their specific situations in the modes
of material nature. Those who are situated in goodness generally worship the
demigods. The demigods include Brahmä, Çiva and others such as Indra, Candra and
the sun-god. There are various demigods. Those in goodness worship a particular
demigod for a particular purpose. Similarly, those who are in the mode of
passion worship the demons. We recall that during the Second World War, a man in
Calcutta worshiped Hitler because thanks to that war he had amassed a large
amount of wealth by dealing in the black market. Similarly, those in the modes
of passion and ignorance generally select a powerful man to be God. They think
that anyone can be worshiped as God and that the same results will be obtained.

Now, it is clearly described here that those who are in the mode of passion
worship and create such gods, and those who are in the mode of ignorance, in
darkness, worship dead spirits. Sometimes people worship at the tomb of some
dead man. Sexual service is also considered to be in the mode of darkness.
Similarly, in remote villages in India there are worshipers of ghosts. We have
seen that in India the lower class people sometimes go to the forest, and if
they have knowledge that a ghost lives in a tree, they worship that tree and
offer sacrifices. These different kinds of worship are not actually God worship.
God worship is for persons who are transcendentally situated in pure goodness.
In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam it is said, sattvaà viçuddham väsudeva-çabditam. “When
a man is situated in pure goodness, he worships Väsudeva.” The purport is that
those who are completely purified of the material modes of nature and who are
transcendentally situated can worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

The impersonalists are supposed to be situated in the mode of goodness, and they
worship five kinds of demigods. They worship the impersonal Viñëu, or Viñëu form
in the material world, which is known as philosophized Viñëu. Viñëu is the
expansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but the impersonalists, because
they do not ultimately believe in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, imagine
that the Viñëu form is just another aspect of the impersonal Brahman; similarly,
they imagine that Lord Brahmä is the impersonal form in the material mode of
passion. Thus they sometimes describe five kinds of gods that are worshipable,
but because they think that the actual truth is impersonal Brahman, they dispose
of all worshipable objects at the ultimate end. In conclusion, the different
qualities of the material modes of nature can be purified through association
with persons who are of transcendental nature.

TRANSLATION
Those who undergo severe austerities and penances not recommended in the
scriptures, performing them out of pride, egotism, lust and attachment, who are
impelled by passion and who torture their bodily organs as well as the Supersoul
dwelling within are to be known as demons.

PURPORT
There are persons who manufacture modes of austerity and penances which are not
mentioned in the scriptural injunctions. For instance, fasting for some ulterior
purpose, such as to promote a purely political end, is not mentioned in the
scriptural directions. The scriptures recommend fasting for spiritual
advancement, not for some political end or social purpose. Persons who take to
such austerities are, according to Bhagavad-gétä, certainly demoniac. Their acts
are against the scriptural injunction and are not beneficial for the people in
general. Actually, they act out of pride, false ego, lust and attachment for
material enjoyment. By such activities, not only are the combination of material
elements of which the body is constructed disturbed, but also the Supreme
Personality of Godhead Himself living within the body. Such unauthorized fasting
or austerities for some political end are certainly very disturbing to others.
They are not mentioned in the Vedic literature. A demoniac person may think that
he can force his enemy or other parties to comply with his desire by this
method, but sometimes one dies by such fasting. These acts are not approved by
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He says that those who engage in them
are demons. Such demonstrations are insults to the Supreme Personality of
Godhead because they are enacted in disobedience to the Vedic scriptural
injunctions. The word acetasaù is significant in this connection—persons of
normal mental condition must obey the scriptural injunctions. Those who are not
in such a position neglect and disobey the scriptures and manufacture their own
way of austerities and penances. One should always remember the ultimate end of
the demoniac people, as described in the previous chapter. The Lord forces them
to take birth in the womb of demoniac persons. Consequently they will live by
demoniac principles life after life without knowing their relationship with the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. If, however, such persons are fortunate enough
to be guided by a spiritual master who can direct them to the path of Vedic
wisdom, they can get out of this entanglement and ultimately achieve the supreme
goal.

Even food of which all partake is of three kinds, according to the three modes

Listen, and I shall tell you of the distinctions of these.

PURPORT
In terms of different situations and the modes of material nature, there are
differences in the manner of eating, performing sacrifices, austerities and
charities. They are not all conducted on the same level. Those who can
understand analytically what kind of performances are in what modes of material
nature are actually wise; those who consider all kinds of sacrifice or foods or
charity to be the same cannot discriminate, and they are foolish. There are
missionary workers who advocate that one can do whatever he likes and attain
perfection. But these foolish guides are not acting according to the direction
of the scripture. They are manufacturing ways and misleading the people in
general.

TRANSLATION
Foods in the mode of goodness increase the duration of life, purify one’s
existence and give strength, health, happiness and satisfaction. Such nourishing
foods are sweet, juicy, fattening and palatable. Foods that are too bitter, too
sour, salty, pungent, dry and hot, are liked by people in the modes of passion.
Such foods cause pain, distress, and disease. Food cooked more than three hours
before being eaten, which is tasteless, stale, putrid, decomposed and unclean,
is food liked by people in the mode of ignorance.

PURPORT
Thc purpose of food is to increase the duration of life, purify the mind and aid
bodily strength. This is its only purpose. In the past, great authorities
selected those foods that best aid health and increase life’s duration, such as
milk products, sugar, rice, wheat, fruits and vegetables. These foods are very
dear to those in the mode of goodness. Some other foods, such as baked corn and
molasses, while not very palatable in themselves, can be made pleasant when
mixed with milk or other foods. They are then in the mode of goodness. All these
foods are pure by nature. They are quite distinct from untouchable things like
meat and liquor. Fatty foods, as mentioned in the eighth verse, have no
connection with animal fat obtained by slaughter. Animal fat is available in the
form of milk, which is the most wonderful of all foods. Milk, butter, cheese and
similar products give animal fat in a form which rules out any need for the
killing of innocent creatures. It is only through brute mentality that this
killing goes on. The civilized method of obtaining needed fat is by milk.
Slaughter is the way of subhumans. Protein is amply available through split
peas, dhall, whole wheat, etc.

Foods in the mode of passion, which are bitter, too salty, or too hot or overly
mixed with red pepper, cause misery by producing mucous in the stomach, leading
to disease. Foods in the mode of ignorance or darkness are essentially those
that are not fresh. Any food cooked more than three hours before it is eaten
(except prasädam, food offered to the Lord) is considered to be in the mode of
darkness. Because they are decomposing, such foods give a bad odor, which often
attracts people in this mode but repulses those in the mode of goodness.

Remnants of food may be eaten only when they are part of a meal that was first
offered to the Supreme Lord or first eaten by saintly persons, especially the
spiritual master. Otherwise the remnants of food are considered to be in the
mode of darkness, and they increase infection or disease. Such foodstuffs,
although very palatable to persons in the mode of darkness, are neither liked
nor even touched by those in the mode of goodness. The best food is the remnant
of what is offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In Bhagavad-gétä the
Supreme Lord says that He accepts preparations of vegetables, flour and milk
when offered with devotion. Patraà puñpaà phalaà toyam. Of course, devotion and
love are the chief things which the Supreme Personality of Godhead accepts. But
it is also mentioned that the prasädam should be prepared in a particular way.
Any food prepared by the injunction of the scripture offered to the Supreme
Personality of Godhead can be taken even if prepared long, long ago, because
such food is transcendental. Therefore to make food antiseptic, eatable and
palatable for all persons, one should offer food to the Supreme Personality of
Godhead.

TRANSLATION
Of sacrifices, that sacrifice performed according to duty and to scriptural
rules, and with no expectation of reward, is of the nature of goodness.

PURPORT
The general tendency is to offer sacrifice with some purpose in mind, but here
it is stated that sacrifice should be performed without any such desire. It
should be done as a matter of duty. Take, for example, the performance of
rituals in temples or in churches. Generally they are performed with the purpose
of material benefit, but that is not in the mode of goodness. One should go to a
temple or church as a matter of duty, offer respect to the Supreme Personality
of Godhead and offer flowers and eatables. Everyone thinks that there is no use
in going to the temple just to worship God. But worship for economic benefit is
not recommended in the scriptural injunction. One should go simply to offer
respect to the Deity. That will place one in the mode of goodness. It is the
duty of every civilized man to obey the injunctions of the scriptures and offer
respect to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

TRANSLATION
But that sacrifice performed for some material end or benefit or performed
ostentatiously, out of pride, is of the nature of passion, O chief of the
Bhäratas.

PURPORT
Sometimes sacrifices and rituals are performed for elevation to the heavenly
kingdom or for some material benefits in this world. Such sacrifices or
ritualistic performances are considered to be in the mode of passion.

prasädam; mantra-hénam—with no chanting of the Vedic hymns; adakñiëam—with no
remunerations to the priests; çraddhä—faith; virahitam—without;
yajïam—sacrifice; tämasam—in the mode of ignorance; paricakñate—is to be
considered.

TRANSLATION
And that sacrifice performed in defiance of scriptural injunctions, in which no
spiritual food is distributed, no hymns are chanted and no remunerations are
made to the priests, and which is faithless—that sacrifice is of the nature of
ignorance.

PURPORT
Faith in the mode of darkness or ignorance is actually faithlessness. Sometimes
people worship some demigod just to make money and then spend the money for
recreation, ignoring the scriptural injunctions. Such ceremonial shows of
religiosity are not accepted as genuine. They are all in the mode of darkness;
they produce a demoniac mentality and do not benefit human society.

ärjavam—simplicity; brahma-caryam—celibacy; ahiàsä—nonviolence; ca—also;

TRANSLATION
The austerity of the body consists in this: worship of the Supreme Lord, the
brähmaëas, the spiritual master, and superiors like the father and mother.
Cleanliness, simplicity, celibacy and nonviolence are also austerities of the
body.

PURPORT
The Supreme Godhead here explains the different kinds of austerity and penance.
First He explains the austerities and penances practiced by the body. One should
offer, or learn to offer, respect to God or to the demigods, the perfect,
qualified brähmaëas and the spiritual master and superiors like father, mother
or any person who is conversant with Vedic knowledge. These should be given
proper respect. One should practice cleansing oneself externally and internally,
and he should learn to become simple in behavior. He should not do anything
which is not sanctioned by the scriptural injunction. He should not indulge in
sex outside of married life, for sex is sanctioned in the scripture only in
marriage, not otherwise. This is called celibacy. These are penances and
austerities as far as the body is concerned.

priya—dear; hitam—beneficial; ca—also; yat—which; svädhyäya—Vedic study;
abhyasanam—practice; ca—also; eva—certainly; väìmayaà—of the voice;
tapaù—austerity; ucyate—is said to be.

TRANSLATION
Austerity of speech consists in speaking truthfully and beneficially and in
avoiding speech that offends. One should also recite the Vedas regularly.

PURPORT
One should not speak in such a way as to agitate the minds of others. Of course,
when a teacher speaks, he can speak the truth for the instruction of his
students, but such a teacher should not speak to others who are not his students
if he will agitate their minds. This is penance as far as talking is concerned.
Besides that, one should not talk nonsense. When speaking in spiritual circles,
one’s statements must be upheld by the scriptures. One should at once quote from
scriptural authority to back up what he is saying. At the same time, such talk
should be very pleasurable to the ear. By such discussions, one may derive the
highest benefit and elevate human society. There is a limitless stock of Vedic
literature, and one should study this. This is called penance of speech.

others; maunam—gravity; ätma—self; vinigrahaù—control; bhäva—nature;
saàçuddhiù—purification; iti—thus; etat—that is; tapaù—austerity; mänasam—of the
mind; ucyate—is said to be.

TRANSLATION
And serenity, simplicity, gravity, self-control and purity of thought are the
austerities of the mind.

PURPORT
To make the mind austere is to detach it from sense gratification. It should be
so trained that it can be always thinking of doing good for others. The best
training for the mind is gravity in thought. One should not deviate from Kåñëa
consciousness and must always avoid sense gratification. To purify one’s nature
is to become Kåñëa conscious. Satisfaction of the mind can be obtained only by
taking the mind away from thoughts of sense enjoyment. The more we think of
sense enjoyment, the more the mind becomes dissatisfied. In the present age we
unnecessarily engage the mind in so many different ways for sense gratification,
and so there is no possibility of the mind’s becoming satisfied. The best course
is to divert the mind to the Vedic literature, which is full of satisfying
stories, as in the Puräëas and the Mahäbhärata. One can take advantage of this
knowledge and thus become purified. The mind should be devoid of duplicity, and
one should think of the welfare of all. Silence means that one is always
thinking of self-realization. The person in Kåñëa consciousness observes perfect
silence in this sense. Control of the mind means detaching the mind from sense
enjoyment. One should be straightforward in his dealing and thereby purify his
existence. All these qualities together constitute austerity in mental
activities.

TRANSLATION
Those ostentatious penances and austerities which are performed in order to gain
respect, honor and reverence are said to be in the mode of passion. They are
neither stable nor permanent.

PURPORT
Sometimes penance and austerity are executed to attract people and receive
honor, respect and worship from others. Persons in the mode of passion arrange
to be worshiped by subordinates and let them wash their feet and offer riches.
Such arrangements artificially made by the performance of penances are
considered to be in the mode of passion. The results are temporary; they can be
continued for some time, but they are not permanent.

TRANSLATION
And those penances and austerities which are performed foolishly by means of
obstinant self-torture, or to destroy or injure others, are said to be in the
mode of ignorance.

PURPORT
There are instances of foolish penance undertaken by demons like Hiraëyakaçipu,
who performed austere penances to become immortal and kill the demigods. He
prayed to Brahmä for such things, but ultimately he was killed by the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. To undergo penances for something which is impossible is
certainly in the mode of ignorance.

TRANSLATION
That gift which is given out of duty, at the proper time and place, to a worthy
person, and without expectation of return, is considered to be charity in the
mode of goodness.

PURPORT
In the Vedic literature, charity given to a person engaged in spiritual
activities is recommended. There is no recommendation for giving charity
indiscriminately. Spiritual perfection is always a consideration. Therefore
charity is recommended to be given at a place of pilgrimage and at lunar or
solar eclipses or at the end of the month or to a qualified brähmaëa or a
Vaiñëava (devotee) or in temples. Such charities should be given without any
consideration of return. Charity to the poor is sometimes given out of
compassion, but if a poor man is not worth giving charity to, then there is no
spiritual advancement. In other words, indiscriminate charity is not recommended
in the Vedic literature.

return; phalam—result; uddiçya—desiring; vä—or; punaù—again; déyate—is given in
charity; ca—also; parikliñöam—grudgingly; tat—that; dänam—charity; räjasam—in
the mode of passion; småtam—is understood to be.

TRANSLATION
But charity performed with the expectation of some return, or with a desire for
fruitive results, or in a grudging mood, is said to be charity in the mode of
passion.

PURPORT
Charity is sometimes performed for elevation to the heavenly kingdom and
sometimes with great trouble and with repentance afterwards. “Why have I spent
so much in this way?” Charity is also sometimes made under some obligation, at
the request of a superior. These kinds of charity are said to be made in the
mode of passion.

There are many charitable foundations which offer their gifts to institutions
where sense gratification goes on. Such charities are not recommended in the
Vedic scripture. Only charity in the mode of goodness is recommended.

darkness; udähåtam—is said to be.

TRANSLATION
And charity performed at an improper place and time and given to unworthy
persons without respect and with contempt is charity in the mode of ignorance.

PURPORT
Contributions for indulgence in intoxication and gambling are not encouraged
here. That sort of contribution is in the mode of ignorance. Such charity is not
beneficial; rather, sinful persons are encouraged. Similarly, if a person gives
charity to a suitable person without respect and without attention, that sort of
charity is also said to be in the mode of darkness.

TRANSLATION
From the beginning of creation, the three syllables—om tat sat—have been used to
indicate the Supreme Absolute Truth [Brahman]. They were uttered by brähmaëas
while chanting Vedic hymns and during sacrifices, for the satisfaction of the
Supreme.

PURPORT
It has been explained that penance, sacrifice, charity and foods are divided
into three categories: the modes of goodness, passion and ignorance. But whether
first class, second class or third class, they are all conditioned, contaminated
by the material modes of nature. When they are aimed at the Supreme—om tat sat,
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the eternal—they become means for spiritual
elevation. In the scriptural injunctions such an objective is indicated. These
three words, om tat sat, particularly indicate the Absolute Truth, the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. In the Vedic hymns, the word om is always found.

One who acts without following the regulations of the scriptures will not attain
the Absolute Truth. He will get some temporary result, but not the ultimate end
of life. The conclusion is that the performance of charities, sacrifice and
penance must be done in the mode of goodness. Performed in the modes of passion
or ignorance, they are certainly inferior in quality. The three words om tat sat
are uttered in conjunction with the holy name of the Supreme Lord, e.g., om tad
viñëoù. Whenever a Vedic hymn or the holy name of the Supreme Lord is uttered,
om is added. This is the indication of Vedic literature. These three words are
taken from Vedic hymns. Om ity etad brahmaëo nediñöaà näma indicates the first
goal. Then tattvamasi indicates the second goal. And sad eva saumya indicates
the third goal. Combined they become om tat sat. Formerly when Brahmä, the first
created living entity, performed sacrifices, he spoke these three names of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. The same principle holds by disciplic
succession. So this hymn has great significance. Bhagavad-gétä recommends,
therefore, that any work done should be done for om tat sat, or for the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. When one performs penance, charity, and sacrifice with
these three words, he is acting in Krñna consciousness. Kåñëa consciousness is a
scientific execution of transcendental activities which enables one to return
home, back to Godhead. There is no loss of energy in acting in such a
transcendental way.

Thus the transcendentalists undertake sacrifices, charities, and penances,
beginning always with om, to attain the Supreme.

platform. The performance of everything on behalf of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead assures the perfection of all activity.

TRANSLATION
One should perform sacrifice, penance and charity with the word tat. The purpose
of such transcendental activities is to get free from the material entanglement.

PURPORT
To be elevated to the spiritual position, one should not act for any material
gain. Acts should be performed for the ultimate gain of being transferred to the
spiritual kingdom, back to home, back to Godhead.

TRANSLATION
The Absolute Truth is the objective of devotional sacrifice, and it is indicated
by the word sat. These works of sacrifice, of penance and of charity, true to
the absolute nature, are performed to please the Supreme Person, O son of Påthä.

PURPORT
The words praçaste karmaëi, or prescribed duties, indicate that there are many
activities prescribed in the Vedic literature which are purificatory processes
beginning from parental care up to the end of one’s life. Such purificatory
processes are adopted for the ultimate liberation of the living entity. In all
such activities it is recommended that one should vibrate om tat sat. The words
sad-bhäve and sädhu-bhäve indicate the transcendental situation. One who is
acting in Kåñëa consciousness is called sattva, and one who is fully conscious
of activities in Kåñëa consciousness is called svarüpa. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam
it is said that the transcendental subject matter becomes clear in the
association of the devotees. Without good association, one cannot achieve
transcendental knowledge. When initiating a person or offering the sacred
thread, one vibrates the words om tat sat. Similarly, in all kinds of yogic
performances, the supreme object, om tat sat is invoked. These words om tat sat
are used to perfect all activities. This supreme om tat sat makes everything
complete.

TRANSLATION
But sacrifices, austerities and charities performed without faith in the Supreme
are nonpermanent, O son of Påthä, regardless of whatever rites are performed.
They are called asat and are useless both in this life and the next.

PURPORT
Anything done without the transcendental objective—whether it be sacrifice,
charity or penance-is useless. Therefore, in this verse, it is declared that
such activities are abominable. Everything should be done for the Supreme in
Kåñëa consciousness. Without such faith, and without the proper guidance, there
can never be any fruit. In all the Vedic scriptures, faith in the Supreme is
advised. In the pursuit of all Vedic instructions, the ultimate goal is the
understanding of Kåñëa. No one can obtain success without following this
principle. Therefore, the best course is to work from the very beginning in
Kåñëa consciousness under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master. That is
the way to make everything successful.

In the conditional state, people are attracted to worship demigods, ghosts, or
Yakñas like Kuvera. The mode of goodness is better than the modes of passion and
ignorance, but one who takes directly to Kåñëa consciousness is transcendental
to all three modes of material nature. Although there is a process of gradual
elevation, if one, by the association of pure devotees, takes directly to Kåñëa
consciousness, that is the best way. And that is recommended in this chapter. To
achieve success in this way, one must first find the proper spiritual master and
receive training under his direction. Then one can achieve faith in the Supreme.
When that faith matures, in course of time, it is called love of God. This love
is the ultimate goal of the living entities. One should, therefore, take to
Krñëa consciousness directly. That is the message of this Seventeenth Chapter.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Seventeenth Chapter of the
Çrémad-Bhagavad-gétä in the matter of the Divisions of Faith.



CHAPTER EIGHTEEN

Conclusion—The Perfection of Renunciation

TRANSLATION
Arjuna said, O mighty-armed one, I wish to understand the purpose of
renunciation [tyäga] and of the renounced order of life [sannyäsa], O killer of
the Keçé demon, Håñékeça.

PURPORT
Actually the Bhagavad-gétä is finished in seventeen chapters. The Eighteenth
Chapter is a supplementary summarization of the topics discussed before. In
every chapter of Bhagavad-gétä, Lord Kåñëa stresses that devotional service unto
the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ultimate goal of life. This same point
is summarized in the Eighteenth Chapter as the most confidential path of
knowledge. In the first six chapters, stress was given to devotional service:
yoginäm api sarveñäm… “Of all yogés or transcendentalists, one who always thinks
of Me within himself is best.” In the next six chapters, pure devotional service
and its nature and activity were discussed. In the third six chapters,
knowledge, renunciation, the activities of material nature and transcendental
nature, and devotional service were described. It was concluded that all acts
should be performed in conjunction with the Supreme Lord, summarized by the
words om tat sat, which indicate Viñëu, the Supreme Person. In the third part of
Bhagavad-gétä, devotional service was established by the example of past äcäryas
and the Brahma-sütra, the Vedänta-sütra, which cites that devotional service is
the ultimate purpose of life and nothing else. Certain impersonalists consider
themselves monopolizers of the knowledge of Vedänta-sütra, but actually the
Vedänta-sütra is meant for understanding devotional service, for the Lord
Himself is the composer of the Vedänta-sütra, and He is its knower. That is
described in the Fifteenth Chapter. In every scripture, every Veda, devotional
service is the objective. That is explained in Bhagavad-gétä.

As in the Second Chapter a synopsis of the whole subject matter was described,
similarly, in the Eighteenth Chapter also the summary of all instruction is
given. The purpose of life is indicated to be renunciation and attainment of the
transcendental position above the three material modes of nature. Arjuna wants
to clarify the two distinct subject matters of Bhagavad-gétä, namely
renunciation (tyäga) and the renounced order of life (sannyäsa). Thus he is
asking the meaning of these two words.

Two words used in this verse to address the Supreme Lord—Håñékeça and
Keçinisüdana—are significant. Håñékeça is Kåñëa, the master of all senses, who
can always help us attain mental serenity. Arjuna requests Him to summarize
everything in such a way that he can remain equiposed. Yet he has some doubts,
and doubts are always compared to demons. He therefore addresses Kåñëa as
Keçinisüdana. Keçé was a most formidable demon who was killed by the Lord; now
Arjuna is expecting Kåñëa to kill the demon of doubt.

life; kavayaù—the learned; viduù—know; sarva—all; karma—activities; phala—of

TRANSLATION
The Supreme Lord said, To give up the results of all activities is called
renunciation [tyäga] by the wise. And that state is called the renounced order
of life [sannyäsa] by great learned men.

PURPORT
The performance of activities for results has to be given up. This is the
instruction of Bhagavad-gétä. But activities leading to advanced spiritual
knowledge are not to be given up. This will be made clear in the next verse.
There are many prescriptions of methods for performing sacrifice for some
particular purpose in the Vedic literatures. There are certain sacrifices to
perform to attain a good son or to attain elevation to the higher planets, but
sacrifices prompted by desires should be stopped. However, sacrifice for the
purification of one’s heart or for advancement in the spiritual science should
not be given up.

TRANSLATION
Some learned men declare that all kinds of fruitive activities should be given
up, but there are yet other sages who maintain that acts of sacrifice, charity
and penance should never be abandoned.

PURPORT
There are many activities in the Vedic literatures which are subjects of
contention. For instance, it is said that an animal can be killed in a
sacrifice, yet some maintain animal killing is completely abominable. Although
animal killing in a sacrifice is recommended in the Vedic literature, the animal
is not considered to be killed. The sacrifice is to give a new life to the
animal. Sometimes the animal is given a new animal life after being killed in
the sacrifice, and sometimes the animal is promoted immediately to the human
form of life. But there are different opinions among the sages. Some say that
animal killing should always be avoided, and others say that for a specific
sacrifice it is good. All these different opinions on sacrificial activity are
now being clarified by the Lord Himself.

TRANSLATION
O best of the Bhäratas, hear from Me now about renunciation. O tiger among men,
there are three kinds of renunciation declared in the scriptures.

PURPORT
Although there are differences of opinion about renunciation, here the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Çré Kåñëa, gives His judgment, which should be taken as
final. After all, the Vedas are different laws given by the Lord. Here the Lord
is personally present, and His word should be taken as final. The Lord says that
the process of renunciation should be considered in terms of the modes of
material nature in which they are performed.

TRANSLATION
Acts of sacrifice, charity and penance are not to be given up but should be
performed. Indeed, sacrifice, charity and penance purify even the great souls.

PURPORT
The yogés should perform acts for the advancement of human society. There are
many purificatory processes for advancing a human being to spiritual life. The
marriage ceremony, for example, is considered to be one of these sacrifices. It
is called viväha-yajïa. Should a sannyäsé, who is in the renounced order of life
and who has given up his family relations, encourage the marriage ceremony? The
Lord says here that any sacrifice which is meant for human welfare should never
be given up. Viväha-yajïa, the marriage ceremony, is meant to regulate the human
mind to become peaceful for spiritual advancement. For most men, this
viväha-yajïa should be encouraged even by persons in the renounced order of
life. Sannyasés should never associate with women, but that does not mean that
one who is in the lower stages of life, a young man, should not accept a wife in
the marriage ceremony. All prescribed sacrifices are meant for achieving the
Supreme Lord. Therefore, in the lower stages, they should not be given up.
Similarly, charity is for the purification of the heart. If charity is given to
suitable persons, as described previously, it leads one to advanced spiritual
life.

TRANSLATION
All these activities should be performed without any expectation of result. They
should be performed as a matter of duty, O son of Påthä. That is My final
opinion.

PURPORT
Although all sacrifices are purifying, one should not expect any result by such
performances. In other words, all sacrifices which are meant for material
advancement in life should be given up, but sacrifices that purify one’s
existence and elevate one to the spiritual plane should not be stopped.
Everything that leads to Kåñëa consciousness must be encouraged. In the
Çrémad-Bhägavatam also it is said that any activity which leads to devotional
service to the Lord should be accepted. That is the highest criterion of
religion. A devotee of the Lord should accept any kind of work, sacrifice, or
charity which will help him in the discharge of devotional service to the Lord

TRANSLATION
Prescribed duties should never be renounced. If, by illusion, one gives up his
prescribed duties, such renunciation is said to be in the mode of ignorance.

PURPORT
Work for material satisfaction must be given up, but activities which promote
one to spiritual activity, like cooking for the Supreme Lord and offering the
food to the Lord and then accepting the food, are recommended. It is said that a
person in the renounced order of life should not cook for himself. Cooking for
oneself is prohibited, but cooking for the Supreme Lord is not prohibited.
Similarly, a sannyäsé may perform a marriage ceremony to help his disciple in
the advancement of Kåñëa consciousness. If one renounces such activities, it is
to be understood that he is acting in the mode of darkness.

TRANSLATION
Anyone who gives up prescribed duties as troublesome, or out of fear, is said to
be in the mode of passion. Such action never leads to the elevation of
renunciation.

PURPORT
One who is in Kåñëa consciousness should not give up earning money out of fear
that he is performing fruitive activities. If by working one can engage his
money in Kåñëa consciousness, or if by rising early in the morning one can
advance his transcendental Kåñëa consciousness, one should not desist out of
fear or because such activities are considered troublesome. Such renunciation is
in the mode of passion. The result of passionate work is always miserable. Even
if a person renounces work in that spirit, he never gets the result of
renunciation.

TRANSLATION
But he who performs his prescribed duty only because it ought to be done, and
renounces all attachment to the fruit—his renunciation is of the nature of
goodness, O Arjuna.

PURPORT
Prescribed duties must be performed with this mentality. One should act without
attachment for the result; he should be disassociated from the modes of work. A
man working in Kåñëa consciousness in a factory does not associate himself with
the work of the factory, nor with the workers of the factory. He simply works
for Kåñëa. And when he gives up the result for Kåñëa, he is acting
transcendentally.

TRANSLATION
Those who are situated in the mode of goodness, who neither hate inauspicious
work nor are attached to auspicious work, have no doubts about work.

PURPORT
It is said in Bhagavad-gétä that one can never give up work at any time.
Therefore he who works for Kåñëa and does not enjoy the fruitive results, who
offers everything to Kåñëa, is actually a renouncer. There are many members of
the International Society for Krishna Consciousness who work very hard in their
office or in the factory or some other place, and whatever they earn they give
to the Society. Such highly elevated souls are actually sannyäsés and are
situated in the renounced order of life. It is clearly outlined here how to
renounce the fruits of work and for what purpose fruits should be renounced.

TRANSLATION
It is indeed impossible for an embodied being to give up all activities.
Therefore it is said that he who renounces the fruits of action is one who has
truly renounced.

PURPORT
A person in Kåñëa consciousness acting in knowledge of his relationship with
Kåñëa is always liberated. Therefore he does not have to enjoy or suffer the
results of his acts after death.

TRANSLATION
For one who is not renounced, the threefold fruits of action—desirable,
undesirable and mixed—accrue after death. But those who are in the renounced
order of life have no such results to suffer or enjoy.

PURPORT
A person in Kåñëa consciousness or in the mode of goodness does not hate anyone
or anything which troubles his body. He does work in the proper place and at the
proper time without fearing the troublesome effects of his duty. Such a person
situated in transcendence should be understood to be most intelligent and beyond
all doubts in his activities.

TRANSLATION
O mighty-armed Arjuna, learn from Me of the five factors which bring about the
accomplishment of all action. These are declared in säìkhya philosophy to be the
place of action, the performer, the senses, the endeavor, and ultimately the
Supersoul.

PURPORT
A question may be raised that since any activity performed must have some
reaction, how is it that the person in Kåñëa consciousness does not suffer or
enjoy the reactions of work? The Lord is citing Vedänta philosophy to show how
this is possible. He says that there are five causes for all activities and for
success in all activity, and one should know these five causes. Säìkhya means
the stalk of knowledge, and Vedänta is the final stalk of knowledge accepted by
all leading äcäryas. Even Çaìkara accepts Vedänta-sütra as such. Therefore such
authority should be consulted.

The ultimate will is invested in the Supersoul, as it is stated in the Gétä,
“sarvasya cähaà hådi.” He is engaging everyone in certain activities. Acts done
under His direction from within yield no reaction, either in this life or in the
life after death.

The instruments of action are the senses, and by senses the soul acts in various
ways, and for each and every action there is a different endeavor. But all one’s
activities depend on the will of the Supersoul, who is seated within the heart
as a friend. The Supreme Lord is the super cause. Under these circumstances, he
who is acting in Kåñëa consciousness under the direction of the Supersoul
situated within the heart is naturally not bound by any activity. Those in
complete Kåñëa consciousness are not ultimately responsible for their actions.
Everything is dependant on the supreme will, the Supersoul, the Supreme
Personality of Godhead.

TRANSLATION
Whatever right or wrong action a man performs by body, mind or speech is caused
by these five factors.

PURPORT
The words “right” and “wrong” are very significant in this verse. Right work is
work done in terms of the prescribed directions in the scriptures, and wrong
work is work done against the principles of the scriptural injunctions. But
whatever is done requires these five factors for its complete performance.

TRANSLATION
Therefore one who thinks himself the only doer, not considering the five
factors, is certainly not very intelligent and cannot see things as they are.

PURPORT
A foolish person cannot understand that the Supersoul is sitting as a friend
within and conducting his actions. Although the material causes are the place,
the worker, the endeavor and the senses, the final cause is the Supreme, the
Personality of Godhead. Therefore, one should see not only the four material
causes, but the supreme efficient cause as well. One who does not see the
Supreme thinks himself to be the instrument.

TRANSLATION
One who is not motivated by false ego, whose intelligence is not entangled,
though he kills men in this world, is not the slayer. Nor is he bound by his
actions.

PURPORT
In this verse the Lord informs Arjuna that the desire not to fight arises from
false ego. Arjuna thought himself to be the doer of action, but he did not
consider the Supreme sanction within and without. If one does not know that a
super sanction is there, why should he act? But one who knows the instrument of
work, himself as the worker, and the Supreme Lord as the supreme sanctioner, is
perfect in doing everything. Such a person is never in illusion. Personal
activity and responsibility arise from false ego and godlessness, or a lack of
Kåñëa consciousness. Anyone who is acting in Kåñëa consciousness under the
direction of the Supersoul or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, even though
killing, does not kill. Nor is he ever affected with the reaction of such
killing. When a soldier kills under the command of a superior officer, he is not
subject to be judged. But if a soldier kills on his own personal account, then
he is certainly judged by a court of law.

TRANSLATION
Knowledge, the object of knowledge and the knower are the three factors which
motivate action; the senses, the work and the doer comprise the threefold basis
of action.

PURPORT
There are three kinds of impetus for daily work: knowledge, the object of
knowledge and the knower. The instruments of work, the work itself and the
worker are called the constituents of work. Any work done by any human being has
these elements. Before one acts, there is some impetus, which is called
inspiration. Any solution arrived at before work is actualized is a subtle form
of work. Then work takes the form of action. First one has to undergo the
psychological processes of thinking, feeling and willing, and that is called
impetus. Actually the faith to perform acts is called knowledge. The inspiration
to work is the same if it comes from the scripture or from the instruction of
the spiritual master. When the inspiration is there and the worker is there,
then actual activity takes place by the help of the senses. The mind is the
center of all senses, and the object is work itself. These are the different
phases of work as described in Bhagavad-gétä. The sum total of all activities is
called accumulation of work.

TRANSLATION
In accordance with the three modes of material nature, there are three kinds of
knowledge, action, and performers of action. Listen as I describe them.

PURPORT
In the Fourteenth Chapter the three divisions of the modes of material nature
were elaborately described. In that chapter it was said that the mode of
goodness is illuminating, the mode of passion materialistic, and the mode of
ignorance conducive to laziness and indolence. All the modes of material nature
are binding; they are not sources of liberation. Even in the mode of goodness
one is conditioned. In the Seventeenth Chapter, the different types of worship
by different types of men in different modes of material nature were described.
In this verse, the Lord wishes to speak about the different types of knowledge,
workers, and work itself according to the three material modes.

TRANSLATION
That knowledge by which one undivided spiritual nature is seen in all
existences, undivided in the divided, is knowledge in the mode of goodness.

PURPORT
A person who sees one spirit soul in every living being, whether a demigod,
human being, animal, bird, beast, aquatic or plant, possesses knowledge in the
mode of goodness. In all living entities, one spirit soul is there, although
they have different bodies in terms of their previous work. As described in the
Seventh Chapter, the manifestation of the living force in every body is due to
the superior nature of the Supreme Lord. Thus to see that one superior nature,
that living force, in every body is to see in the mode of goodness. That living
energy is imperishable, although the bodies are perishable. The difference is
perceived in terms of the body because there are many forms of material
existence in conditional life; therefore they appear to be divided. Such
impersonal knowledge finally leads to self-realization.

viddhi—must be known; räjasam—in terms of passion.

TRANSLATION
That knowledge by which a different type of living entity is seen to be dwelling
in different bodies is knowledge in the mode of passion.

PURPORT
The concept that the material body is the living entity and that with the
destruction of the body the consciousness is also destroyed is called knowledge
in the mode of passion. According to that knowledge, bodies differ from one
another because of the development of different types of consciousness,
otherwise there is no separate soul which manifests consciousness. The body is
itself the soul, and there is no separate soul beyond this body. According to
such knowledge, consciousness is temporary. Or else there are no individual
souls, but there is an all-pervading soul, which is full of knowledge, and this
body is a manifestation of temporary ignorance. Or beyond this body there is no
special individual or Supreme Soul. All such conceptions are considered products
of the mode of passion.

TRANSLATION
And that knowledge by which one is attached to one kind of work as the all in
all, without knowledge of the truth, and which is very meager, is said to be in
the mode of darkness.

PURPORT
The “knowledge” of the common man is always in the mode of darkness or ignorance
because every living entity in conditional life is born into the mode of
ignorance. One who does not develop knowledge through the authorities or
scriptural injunctions has knowledge that is limited to the body. He is not
concerned about acting in terms of the directions of scripture. For him God is
money, and knowledge means the satisfaction of bodily demands. Such knowledge
has no connection with the Absolute Truth. It is more or less like the knowledge
of the ordinary animals: the knowledge of eating, sleeping, defending and
mating. Such knowledge is described here as the product of the mode of darkness.
In other words, knowledge concerning the spirit soul beyond this body is called
knowledge in the mode of goodness, and knowledge producing many theories and
doctrines by dint of mundane logic and mental speculation is the product of the
mode of passion, and knowledge concerned with only keeping the body comfortable
is said to be in the mode of ignorance.

TRANSLATION
As for actions, that action in accordance with duty, which is performed without
attachment, without love or hate, by one who has renounced fruitive results, is
called action in the mode of goodness.

PURPORT
Regulated occupational duties, as prescribed in the scriptures in terms of the
different orders and divisions of society, performed without attachment or
proprietary rights and therefore without any love or hatred and performed in
Kåñëa consciousness for the satisfaction of the Supreme, without
self-satisfaction or self-gratification, are called actions in the mode of
goodness.

great labor; tat—that; räjasam—in the mode of passion; udähåtam—is said to be.

TRANSLATION
But action performed with great effort by one seeking to gratify his desires,
and which is enacted from a sense of false ego, is called action in the mode of
passion.

illusion; ärabhyate—begun; karma—work; yat—that; tat—which; tämasam—in the mode
of ignorance; ucyate—is said to be.

TRANSLATION
And that action performed in ignorance and delusion without consideration of
future bondage or consequences, which inflicts injury and is impractical, is
said to be action in the mode of ignorance.

PURPORT
One has to give account of one’s actions to the state or to the agents of the
Supreme Lord called the Yamadütas. Irresponsible work is distraction because it
destroys the regulative principles of scriptural injunction. It is often based
on violence and is distressing to other living entities. Such irresponsible work
is carried out in the light of one’s personal experience. This is called
illusion. And all such illusory work is a product of the mode of ignorance.

TRANSLATION
The worker who is free from all material attachments and false ego, who is
enthusiastic and resolute and who is indifferent to success or failure, is a
worker in the mode of goodness.

PURPORT
A person in Kåñëa consciousness is always transcendental to the material modes
of nature. He has no expectations for the result of the work entrusted to him
because he is above false ego and pride. Still, he is always enthusiastic till
the completion of such work. He does not worry about the distress undertaken; he
is always enthusiastic. He does not care for success or failure; he is equal
both in distress or happiness. Such a worker is situated in the mode of
goodness.

TRANSLATION
But that worker who is attached to the fruits of his labor and who passionately
wants to enjoy them, who is greedy, envious and impure and moved by happiness
and distress, is a worker in the mode of passion.

PURPORT
A person is too much attached to certain kind of work or to the result because
he has too much attachment for materialism or hearth and home, wife and
children. Such a person has no desire for higher elevation of life. He is simply
concerned with making this world as materially comfortable as possible. He is
generally very greedy, and he thinks that anything attained by him is permanent
and never to be lost. Such a person is envious of others and prepared to do
anything wrong for sense gratification. Therefore such a person is unclean, and
he does not care whether his earning is pure or impure. He is very happy if his
work is successful and very much distressed when his work is not successful.
Such is a man in the mode of passion.

TRANSLATION
And that worker who is always engaged in work against the injunction of the
scripture, who is materialistic, obstinate, cheating and expert in insulting
others, who is lazy, always morose and procrastinating, is a worker in the mode
of ignorance.

PURPORT
In the scriptural injunctions we find what sort of work should be performed and
what sort of work should not be performed. Those who do not care for those
injunctions engage in work not to be done, and such persons are generally
materialistic. They work according to the modes of nature, not according to the
injunctions of the scripture. Such workers are not very gentle, and generally
they are always cunning and expert in insulting others. They are very lazy; even
though they have some duty, they do not do it properly, and they put it aside to
be done later on. Therefore they appear to be morose. They procrastinate;
anything which can be done in an hour they drag on for years. Such workers are
situated in the mode of ignorance.

kinds of understanding and determination according to the three modes of nature.

PURPORT
Now after explaining knowledge, the object of knowledge and the knower, in three
different divisions according to modes of material nature, the Lord is
explaining the intelligence and determination of the worker in the same way.

O son of Påthä, that understanding by which one knows what ought to be done and
what ought not to be done, what is to be feared and what is not to be feared,
what is binding and what is liberating, that understanding is established in the
mode of goodness.

PURPORT
Actions which are performed in terms of the directions of the scriptures are
called pravåtti, or actions that deserve to be performed, and actions which are
not so directed are not to be performed. One who does not know the scriptural
directions becomes entangled in the actions and reactions of work. Understanding
which discriminates by intelligence is situated in the mode of goodness.

TRANSLATION
And that understanding which cannot distinguish between the religious way of
life and the irreligious, between action that should be done and action that
should not be done, that imperfect understanding, O son of Påthä, is in the mode
of passion.

PURPORT
Intelligence in the mode of passion is always working perversely. It accepts
religions which are not actually religions and rejects actual religion. All
views and activities are misguided. Men of passionate intelligence understand a
great soul to be a common man and accept a common man as a great soul. They
think truth to be untruth and accept untruth as truth. In all activities they
simply take the wrong path; therefore their intelligence is in the mode of
passion.

That understanding which considers irreligion to be religion and religion to be
irreligion, under the spell of illusion and darkness, and strives always in the
wrong direction, O Pärtha, is in the mode of ignorance.

TRANSLATION
O son of Påthä, that determination which is unbreakable, which is sustained with
steadfastness by yoga practice, and thus controls the mind, life, and the acts
of the senses, is in the mode of goodness.

PURPORT
Yoga is a means to understand the Supreme Soul. One who is steadily fixed in the
Supreme Soul with determination, concentrating one’s mind, life and sensual
activities on the Supreme, engages in Kåñëa consciousness. That sort of
determination is in the mode of goodness. The word avyabhicäriëya is very
significant, for it refers to persons who are engaged in Kåñëa consciousness and
are never deviated by any other activity.

TRANSLATION
And that determination by which one holds fast to fruitive result in religion,
economic development and sense gratification is of the nature of passion, O
Arjuna.

PURPORT
Any person who is always desirous of fruitive results in religious or economic
activities, whose only desire is sense gratification, and whose mind, life and
senses are thus engaged, is in the mode of passion.

TRANSLATION
And that determination which cannot go beyond dreaming, fearfulness,
lamentation, moroseness, and illusion—such unintelligent determination is in the
mode of darkness.

PURPORT
It should not be concluded that a person in the mode of goodness does not dream.
Here dream means too much sleep. Dream is always present; either in the mode of
goodness, passion or ignorance, dream is a natural occurrence. But those who
cannot avoid oversleeping, who cannot avoid the pride of enjoying material
objects and who are always dreaming of lording it over the material world, whose
life, mind, and senses are thus engaged, are considered to be in the mode of
ignorance.

TRANSLATION
O best of the Bhäratas, now please hear from Me about the three kinds of
happiness which the conditioned soul enjoys, and by which he sometimes comes to
the end of all distress. That which in the beginning may be just like poison but
at the end is just like nectar and which awakens one to self-realization is said
to be happiness in the mode of goodness.

PURPORT
A conditioned soul tries to enjoy material happiness again and again. Thus he
chews the chewed, but, sometimes, in the course of such enjoyment, he becomes
relieved from material entanglement by association with a great soul. In other
words, a conditioned soul is always engaged in some type of sense gratification,
but when he understands by good association that it is only a repetition of the
same thing, and he is awakened to his real Kåñëa consciousness, he is sometimes
relieved from such repetitive so-called happiness.

In the pursuit of self-realization, one has to follow many rules and regulations
to control the mind and the senses and to concentrate the mind on the Self. All
these procedures are very difficult, bitter like poison, but if one is
successful in following the regulations and comes to the transcendental
position, he begins to drink real nectar, and he enjoys life.

passion; småtam—is considered.

TRANSLATION
That happiness which is derived from contact of the senses with their objects
and which appears like nectar at first but poison at the end is said to be of
the nature of passion.

PURPORT
A young man and a young woman meet, and the senses drive the young man to see
her, to touch her and to have sexual intercourse. In the beginning this may be
very pleasing to the senses, but at the end, or after some time, it becomes just
like poison. They are separated or there is divorce, there is lamentation, there
is sorrow, etc. Such happiness is always in the mode of passion. Happiness
derived from a combination of the senses and the sense objects is always a cause
of distress and should be avoided by all means.

TRANSLATION
And that happiness which is blind to self-realization, which is delusion from
beginning to end and which arises from sleep, laziness and illusion is said to
be of the nature of ignorance.

PURPORT
One who takes pleasure in laziness and in sleep is certainly in the mode of
darkness, and one who has no idea how to act and how not to act is also in the
mode of ignorance. For the person in the mode of ignorance, everything is
illusion. There is no happiness either in the beginning or the end. For the
person in the mode of passion there might be some kind of ephemeral happiness in
the beginning and at the end distress, but for the person in the mode of
ignorance there is only distress both in the beginning and at the end.

TRANSLATION
By worship of the Lord, who is the source of all beings and who is
all-pervading, man can, in the performance of his own duty, attain perfection.

PURPORT
As stated in the Fifteenth Chapter, all living beings are fragmental parts and
parcels of the Supreme Lord. As such, the Supreme Lord is the beginning of all
living entities. This is confirmed in the Vedänta-sütra—janmädy asya yataù. The
Supreme Lord is therefore the beginning of life of every living entity. And the
Supreme Lord, by His two energies, His external energy and internal energy, is
all-pervading. Therefore one should worship the Supreme Lord with His energies.
Generally the Vaiñëava devotees worship the Supreme Lord with His internal
energy. His external energy is a perverted reflection of the internal energy.
The external energy is a background, but the Supreme Lord by the expansion of
His plenary portion as Paramätmä is situated everywhere. He is the Supersoul of
all demigods, all human beings, all animals, everywhere. One should therefore
know that as part and parcel of the Supreme Lord it is his duty to render
service unto the Supreme. Everyone should be engaged in devotional service to
the Lord in full Kåñëa consciousness. That is recommended in this verse.

Everyone should think that he is engaged in a particular type of occupation by
Håñékeça, the master of the senses. And, by the result of the work in which one
is engaged, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Çré Kåñëa, should be worshiped.
If one thinks always in this way, in full Kåñëa consciousness, then, by the
grace of the Lord, he becomes fully aware of everything. That is the perfection
of life. The Lord says in Bhagavad-gétä, teñäm ahaà samuddhartä. The Supreme
Lord Himself takes charge of delivering such a devotee. That is the highest
perfection of life. In whatever occupation one may be engaged, if he serves the
Supreme Lord, he will achieve the highest perfection.

svabhäva-niyatam—prescribed duties according to one’s nature; karma—work;

TRANSLATION
It is better to engage in one’s own occupation, even though one may perform it
imperfectly, than to accept another’s occupation and perform it perfectly.
Prescribed duties, according to one’s nature, are never affected by sinful
reactions.

PURPORT
One’s occupational duty is prescribed in Bhagavad-gétä. As already discussed in
previous verses, the duties of a brähmaëa, kñatriya, vaiçya and çüdra are
prescribed according to the particular modes of nature. One should not imitate
another’s duty. A man who is by nature attracted to the kind of work done by
çüdras should not artificially claim himself to be a brähmaëa, although he may
be born into a brähmaëa family. In this way one should work according to his own
nature; no work is abominable, if performed in the service of the Supreme Lord.
The occupational duty of a brähmaëa is certainly in the mode of goodness, but if
a person is not by nature in the mode of goodness, he should not imitate the
occupational duty of a brähmaëa. For a kñatriya, or administrator, there are so
many abominable things; a kñatriya has to be violent to kill his enemies, and
sometimes a kñatriya has to tell lies for the sake of diplomacy. Such violence
and duplicity accompany political affairs, but a kñatriya is not supposed to
give up his occupational duty and try to perform the duties of a brähmaëa.

One should act to satisfy the Supreme Lord. For example, Arjuna was a kñatriya.
He was hesitating to fight the other party. But if such fighting is performed
for the sake of Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there need be no fear
of degradation. In the business field also, sometimes a merchant has to tell so
many lies to make a profit. If he does not do so, there can be no profit.
Sometimes a merchant says, “Oh, my dear customer, for you I am making no
profit,” but one should know that without profit the merchant cannot exist.
Therefore it should be taken as a simple lie if a merchant says that he is not
making a profit. But the merchant should not think that because he is engaged in
an occupation in which the telling of lies is compulsory, he should give up his
profession and pursue the profession of a brähmaëa. That is not recommended.
Whether one is a kñatriya, a vaiçya, or a çüdra doesn’t matter, if he serves, by
his work, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Even brähmaëas, who perform
different types of sacrifice, sometimes must kill animals because sometimes
animals are sacrificed in such ceremonies. Similarly, if a kñatriya engaged in
his own occupation kills an enemy, there is no sin incurred. In the Third
Chapter these matters have been clearly and elaborately explained; every man
should work for the purpose of yajïa, or for Viñëu, the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. Anything done for personal sense gratification is a cause of bondage.
The conclusion is that everyone should be engaged according to the particular
mode of nature he has acquired, and he should decide to work only to serve the
supreme cause of the Supreme Lord.

sarvärambhä hi doñeëa
dhümenägnir ivävåtäù

saha-jam—born simultaneously; karma—work; kaunteya—O son of Kunté; sa-doñam—with
fault; api—although; na—never; tyajet—to be given up; sarva-ärambhäù—any
venture; hi—is certainly; doñeëa—with fault; dhümena—with smoke; agniù—fire;
iva—as; ävåtäù—covered.

TRANSLATION
Every endeavor is covered by some sort of fault, just as fire is covered by
smoke. Therefore one should not give up the work which is born of his nature, O
son of Kunté, even if such work is full of fault.

PURPORT
In conditioned life, all work is contaminated by the material modes of nature.
Even if one is a brähmaëa, he has to perform sacrifices in which animal killing
is necessary. Similarly, a kñatriya, however pious he may be, has to fight
enemies. He cannot avoid it. Similarly, a merchant, however pious he may be,
must sometimes hide his profit to stay in business, or he may sometimes have to
do business on the black market. These things are necessary; one cannot avoid
them. Similarly, even though a man is a çüdra serving a bad master, he has to
carry out the order of the master, even though it should not be done. Despite
these flaws, one should continue to carry out his prescribed duties, for they
are born out of his own nature.

A very nice example is given herein. Although fire is pure, still there is
smoke. Yet smoke does not make the fire impure. Even though there is smoke in
the fire, fire is still considered to be the purest of all elements. If one
prefers to give up the work of a kñatriya and take up the occupation of a
brähmaëa, he is not assured that in the occupation of a brähmaëa there are no
unpleasant duties. One may then conclude that in the material world no one can
be completely free from the contamination of material nature. This example of
fire and smoke is very appropriate in this connection. When in wintertime one
takes a stone from the fire, sometimes smoke disturbs the eyes and other parts
of the body, but still one must make use of the fire despite disturbing
conditions. Similarly, one should not give up his natural occupation because
there are some disturbing elements. Rather, one should be determined to serve
the Supreme Lord by his occupational duty in Kåñëa consciousness. That is the
perfectional point. When a particular type of occupation is performed for the
satisfaction of the Supreme Lord, all the defects in that particular occupation
are purified. When the results of work are purified, when connected with
devotional service, one becomes perfect in seeing the self within, and that is
self-realization.

TRANSLATION
One can obtain the results of renunciation simply by self-control and by
becoming unattached to material things and disregarding material enjoyments.
That is the highest perfectional stage of renunciation.

PURPORT
Real renunciation means that one should always think himself part and parcel of
the Supreme Lord. Therefore he has no right to enjoy the results of his work.
Since he is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, the results of his work must be
enjoyed by the Supreme Lord. This is actually Krñna consciousness. The person
acting in Kåñëa consciousness is really a sannyäsé, one in the renounced order
of life. By such mentality, one is satisfied because he is actually acting for
the Supreme. Thus he is not attached to anything material; he becomes accustomed
to not taking pleasure in anything beyond the transcendental happiness derived
from the service of the Lord. A sannyäsé is supposed to be free from the
reactions of his past activities, but a person who is in Kåñëa consciousness
automatically attains this perfection without even accepting the so-called order
of renunciation. This state of mind is called yogärüòha, or the perfectional
stage of yoga, as confirmed in the Third Chapter: yas tv ätma-ratir eva syät.
One who is satisfied in himself has no fear of any kind of reaction from his
activity.

O son of Kunté, learn from Me in brief how one can attain to the supreme

PURPORT
The Lord describes for Arjuna how one can achieve the highest perfectional stage
simply by being engaged in his occupational duty, performing that duty for the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. One attains the supreme stage of Brahman simply
by renouncing the result of his work for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord.
That is the process of self-realization. Actual perfection of knowledge is in
attaining pure Kåñëa consciousness; that is described in the following verses.

TRANSLATION
Being purified by his intelligence and controlling the mind with determination,
giving up the objects of sense gratification, being freed from attachment and
hatred, one who lives in a secluded place, who eats little and who controls the
body and the tongue, and is always in trance and is detached, who is without
false ego, false strength, false pride, lust, anger, and who does not accept
material things, such a person is certainly elevated to the position of
self-realization.

PURPORT
When one is purified by knowledge, he keeps himself in the mode of goodness.
Thus one becomes the controller of the mind and is always in trance. Because he
is not attached to the objects of sense gratification, he does not eat more than
what he requires, and he controls the activities of his body and mind. He has no
false ego because he does not accept the body as himself. Nor has he a desire to
make the body fat and strong by accepting so many material things. Because he
has no bodily concept of life, he is not falsely proud. He is satisfied with
everything that is offered to him by the grace of the Lord, and he is never
angry in the absence of sense gratification. Nor does he endeavor to acquire
sense objects. Thus when he is completely free from false ego, he becomes
nonattached to all material things, and that is the stage of self-realization of
Brahman. That stage is called the brahma-bhüta stage. When one is free from the
material conception of life, he becomes peaceful and cannot be agitated.

çocati—laments; na—never; käìkñati—desires; samaù—equally disposed; sarveñu—all;

TRANSLATION
One who is thus transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman.
He never laments nor desires to have anything; he is equally disposed to every
living entity. In that state he attains pure devotional service unto Me.

PURPORT
To the impersonalist, achieving the brahma-bhüta stage, becoming one with the
Absolute, is the last word. But for the personalist, or pure devotee, one has to
go still further to become engaged in pure devotional service. This means that
one who is engaged in pure devotional service to the Supreme Lord is already in
a state of liberation, called brahma-bhüta, oneness with the Absolute. Without
being one with the Supreme, the Absolute, one cannot render service unto Him. In
the absolute conception, there is no difference between the served and the
servitor; yet the distinction is there, in a higher spiritual sense.

In the material concept of life, when one works for sense gratification, there
is misery, but in the absolute world, when one is engaged in pure devotional
service, there is no misery. The devotee in Kåñëa consciousness has nothing to
lament or desire. Since God is full, a living entity who is engaged in God’s
service, in Kåñëa consciousness, becomes also full in himself. He is just like a
river cleansed of all dirty water. Because a pure devotee has no thought other
than Kåñëa, he is naturally always joyful. He does not lament for any material
loss or gain because he is full in service of the Lord. He has no desire for
material enjoyment because he knows that every living entity is the fragmental
part and parcel of the Supreme Lord and therefore eternally a servant. He does
not see, in the material world, someone as higher and someone as lower; higher
and lower positions are ephemeral, and a devotee has nothing to do with
ephemeral appearances or disappearances. For him stone and gold are of equal
value. This is the brahma-bhüta stage, and this stage is attained very easily by
the pure devotee. In that stage of existence, the idea of becoming one with the
Supreme Brahman and annihilating one’s individuality becomes hellish, and the
idea of attaining the heavenly kingdom becomes phantasmagoria, and the senses
are like broken serpents’ teeth. As there is no fear of a serpent with broken
teeth, so there is no fear from the senses when they are automatically
controlled. The world is miserable for the materially infected person, but for a
devotee the entire world is as good as Vaikuëöha, or the spiritual sky. The
highest personality in this material universe is no more significant than an ant
for a devotee. Such a stage can be achieved by the mercy of Lord Caitanya, who
preached pure devotional service in this age.

TRANSLATION
One can understand the Supreme Personality as He is only by devotional service.
And when one is in full consciousness of the Supreme Lord by such devotion, he
can enter into the kingdom of God.

PURPORT
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, and His plenary portions cannot be
understood by mental speculation nor by the nondevotees. If anyone wants to
understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he has to take to pure devotional
service under the guidance of a pure devotee. Otherwise, the truth of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead will always be hidden. It is already stated
(nähaà prakäçaù) that He is not revealed to everyone. Everyone cannot understand
God simply by erudite scholarship or mental speculation. Only one who is
actually engaged in Kåñëa consciousness and devotional service can understand
what Kåñëa is. University degrees are not helpful.

One who is fully conversant with the Kåñëa science becomes eligible to enter
into the spiritual kingdom, the abode of Kåñëa. Becoming Brahman does not mean
that one loses his identity. Devotional service is there, and as long as
devotional service exists, there must be God, the devotee, and the process of
devotional service. Such knowledge is never vanquished, even after liberation.
Liberation involves getting free from the concept of material life; in spiritual
life the same distinction is there, the same individuality is there, but in pure
Kåñëa consciousness. One should not misunderstand that the word viçate, “enters
into Me,” supports the monist theory that one becomes homogeneous with the
impersonal Brahman. No. Viçate means that one can enter into the abode of the
Supreme Lord in his individuality to engage in His association and render
service unto Him. For instance, a green bird enters a green tree not to become
one with the tree but to enjoy the fruits of the tree. Impersonalists generally
give the example of a river flowing into the ocean and merging. This may be a
source of happiness for the impersonalist, but the personalist keeps his
personal individuality like an aquatic in the ocean. We find so many living
entities within the ocean, if we go deep. Surface acquaintance with the ocean is
not sufficient; one must have complete knowledge of the aquatics living in the
ocean depths.

Because of his pure devotional service, a devotee can understand the
transcendental qualities and the opulences of the Supreme Lord in truth. As it
is stated in the Eleventh Chapter, only by devotional service can one
understand. The same is confirmed here; one can understand the Supreme
Personality of Godhead by devotional service and enter into His kingdom.

After attainment of the brahma-bhüta stage of freedom from material conceptions,
devotional service begins by one’s hearing about the Lord. When one hears about
the Supreme Lord, automatically the brahma-bhüta stage develops, and material
contamination—greediness and lust for sense enjoyment—disappears. As lust and
desires disappear from the heart of a devotee, he becomes more attached to the
service of the Lord, and by such attachment he becomes free from material
contamination. In that state of life he can understand the Supreme Lord. This is
the statement of Çrémad-Bhägavatam also. Also after liberation the process of
bhakti or transcendental service continues. The Vedänta-sütra confirms this:
äpräyaëät taträpi hi dåñöam. This means that after liberation the process of
devotional service continues. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, real devotional
liberation is defined as the reinstatement of the living entity in his own
identity, his own constitutional position. The constitutional position is
already explained: every living entity is the part and parcel fragmental portion
of the Supreme Lord. Therefore his constitutional position is to serve. After
liberation, this service is never stopped. Actual liberation is getting free
from misconceptions of life.

Though engaged in all kinds of activities, My devotee, under My protection,

PURPORT
The word mad-vyapäçrayaù means under the protection of the Supreme Lord. To be
free from material contamination, a pure devotee acts under the direction of the
Supreme Lord or His representative, the spiritual master. There is no time
limitation for a pure devotee. He is always, twenty-four hours, one hundred
percent engaged in activities under the direction of the Supreme Lord. To a
devotee who is thus engaged in Kåñëa consciousness the Lord is very, very kind.
In spite of all difficulties, he is eventually placed in the transcendental
abode, or Kåñëaloka. He is guaranteed entrance there; there is no doubt about
it. In that supreme abode, there is no change; everything is eternal,
imperishable and full of knowledge.

TRANSLATION
In all activities just depend upon Me and work always under My protection. In
such devotional service, be fully conscious of Me.

PURPORT
When one acts in Kåñëa consciousness, he does not act as the master of the
world. Just like a servant, one should act fully under the direction of the
Supreme Lord. A servant has no individual independence. He acts only on the
order of the master. A servant acting on behalf of the supreme master has no
affection for profit and loss. He simply discharges his duty faithfully in terms
of the order of the Lord. Now, one may argue that Arjuna was acting under the
personal direction of Kåñëa, but, when Kåñëa is not present, how should one act?
If one acts according to the direction of Kåñëa in this book, as well as under
the guidance of the representative of Kåñëa, then the result will be the same.
The Sanskrit word mat-paraù is very important in this verse. It indicates that
one has no goal in life save and except acting in Kåñëa consciousness just to
satisfy Kåñëa. And, while working in that way, one should think of Kåñëa only:
“I have been appointed to discharge this particular duty by Kåñëa.” While acting
in such a way, one naturally has to think of Kåñëa. This is perfect Kåñëa
consciousness. One should, however, note that, after doing something
whimsically, he should not offer the result to the Supreme Lord. That sort of
duty is not in the devotional service of Kåñëa consciousness. One should act
according to the order of Krñna. This is a very important point. That order of
Kåñëa comes through disciplic succession from the bona fide spiritual master.
Therefore the spiritual master’s order should be taken as the prime duty of
life. If one gets a bona fide spiritual master and acts according to his
direction, then his perfection of life in Kåñëa consciousness is guaranteed.

If you become conscious of Me, you will pass over all the obstacles of
conditional life by My grace. If, however, you do not work in such consciousness
but act through false ego, not hearing Me, you will be lost.

PURPORT
A person in full Kåñëa consciousness is not unduly anxious to execute the duties
of his existence. The foolish cannot understand this great freedom from all
anxiety. For one who acts in Kåñëa consciousness, Lord Kåñëa becomes the most
intimate friend. He always looks after His friend’s comfort, and He gives
Himself to His friend, who is so devotedly engaged working twenty-four hours a
day to please the Lord. Therefore, no one should be carried away by the false
ego of the bodily concept of life. One should not falsely think himself
independant of the laws of material nature or free to act. He is already under
strict material laws. But, as soon as he acts in Kåñëa consciousness, he is
liberated, free from the material perplexities. One should note very carefully
that one who is not active in Kåñëa consciousness is losing himself in the
material whirlpool, in the ocean of birth and death. No conditioned soul
actually knows what is to be done and what is not to be done, but a person who
acts in Kåñëa consciousness is free to act because everything is prompted by
Kåñëa from within and confirmed by the spiritual master.

If you do not act according to My direction and do not fight, then you will be

PURPORT
Arjuna was a military man, and born of the nature of the kñatriya. Therefore his
natural duty was to fight. But, due to false ego, he was fearing that by killing
his teacher, grandfather and friends, there would be sinful reactions. Actually
he was considering himself master of his actions, as if he were directing the
good and bad results of such work. He forgot that the Supreme Personality of
Godhead was present there, instructing him to fight. That is the forgetfulness
of the conditioned soul. The Supreme Personality gives directions as to what is
good and what is bad, and one simply has to act in Kåñëa consciousness to attain
the perfection of life. No one can ascertain his destiny as the Supreme Lord
can; therefore the best course is to take direction from the Supreme Lord and
act. No one should neglect the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead or
the order of the spiritual master who is the representative of God. One should
act unhesitatingly to execute the order of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead—that will keep him safe under all circumstances.

Under illusion you are now declining to act according to My direction. But,

If one refuses to act under the direction of the Supreme Lord, then he is
compelled to act by the modes in which he is situated. Everyone is under the
spell of a particular combination of the modes of nature and is acting in that
way. But anyone who voluntarily engages himself under the direction of the
Supreme Lord becomes glorious.

TRANSLATION
The Supreme Lord is situated in everyone’s heart, O Arjuna, and is directing the
wanderings of all living entities, who are seated as on a machine, made of the
material energy.

PURPORT
Arjuna was not the supreme knower, and his decision to fight or not to fight was
confined to his limited discretion. Lord Kåñëa instructed that the individual is
not all in all. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, or He Himself, Kåñëa, the
localized Supersoul, sits in the heart directing the living being. After
changing bodies, the living entity forgets his past deeds, but the Supersoul, as
the knower of the past, present and future, remains the witness of all his
activities. Therefore all the activities of living entities are directed by this
Supersoul. The living entity gets what he deserves and is carried by the
material body which is created in the material energy under the direction of the
Supersoul. As soon as a living entity is placed in a particular type of body, he
has to work under the spell of that bodily situation. A person seated in a
high-speed motor car goes faster than one seated in a slower car, though the
living entities, the drivers, may be the same. Similarly, by the order of the
Supreme Soul, material nature fashions a particular type of body to a particular
type of living entity to work according to his past desires. The living entity
is not independant. One should not think himself independant of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. The individual is always under His control. Therefore
his duty is to surrender, and that is the injunction of the next verse.

TRANSLATION
O scion of Bharata, surrender unto Him utterly. By His grace you will attain
transcendental peace and the supreme and eternal abode.

PURPORT
A living entity should therefore surrender unto the Supreme Personality of
Godhead who is situated in everyone’s heart, and that will relieve him from all
kinds of miseries of this material existence. By such surrender, one will not
only be released from all miseries in this life, but at the end he will reach
the Supreme God. The transcendental world is described in the Vedic literature
as tad viñëoù paramaà padam. Since all of creation is the kingdom of God,
everything material is actually spiritual, but paramaà padam specifically refers
to the eternal abode, which is called the spiritual sky or Vaikuëöha.

In the Fifteenth Chapter of Bhagavad-gétä it is stated: “Sarvasya cäham hådi
sanniviñöaù.” The Lord is seated in everyone’s heart, so this recommendation
that one should surrender unto the Supersoul sitting within means that one
should surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa. Kåñëa has
already been accepted by Arjuna as the Supreme. He was accepted in the Tenth
Chapter as paraà brahma paraà dhäma. Arjuna has accepted Kåñëa as the Supreme
Personality of Godhead and the supreme abode of all living entities, not only
because of his personal experience but also because of the evidences of great
authorities like Närada, Asita, Devala and Vyäsa.

TRANSLATION
Thus I have explained to you the most confidential of all knowledge. Deliberate
on this fully, and then do what you wish to do.

PURPORT
The Lord has already explained to Arjuna the knowledge of brahmabhüta. One who
is in the brahma-bhüta condition is joyful; he never laments, nor does he desire
anything. That is due to confidential knowledge. Kåñëa also discloses knowledge
of the Supersoul. This is also Brahman knowledge, knowledge of Brahman, but it
is superior.

Here Lord Kåñëa telIs Arjuna that he can do as he chooses. God does not
interfere with the little independence of the living entity. In Bhagavad-gétä,
the Lord has explained in all respects how one can elevate his living condition.
The best advice imparted to Arjuna is to surrender unto the Supersoul seated
within his heart. By right discrimination, one should agree to act according to
the order of the Supersoul. That will help one become situated constantly in
Kåñëa consciousness, the highest perfectional stage of human life. Arjuna is
being directly ordered by the Personality of Godhead to fight. Surrender to the
Supreme Personality of Godhead is in the best interest of the living entities.
It is not for the interest of the Supreme. Before surrendering, one is free to
deliberate on this subject as far as the intelligence goes; that is the best way
to accept the instruction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such
instruction comes also through the spiritual master, the bona fide
representative of Kåñëa.

TRANSLATION
Because you are My very dear friend, I am speaking to you the most confidential

PURPORT
The Lord has given Arjuna confidential knowledge of the Supersoul within
everyone’s heart, and now He is giving the most confidential part of this
knowledge: just surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. At the end of
the Ninth Chapter He has said, “Just always think of Me.” The same instruction
is repeated here to stress the essence of the teachings of Bhagavad-gétä. This
essence is not understood by a common man, but by one who is actually very dear
to Kåñëa, a pure devotee of Kåñëa. This is the most important instruction in all
Vedic literature. What Kåñëa is saying in this connection is the most essential
part of knowledge, and it should be carried out not only by Arjuna but by all
living entities.

TRANSLATION
Always think of Me and become My devotee. Worship Me and offer your homage unto
Me. Thus you will come to Me without fail. I promise you this because you are My
very dear friend.

PURPORT
The most confidential part of knowledge is that one should become a pure devotee
of Kåñëa and always think of Him and act for Him. One should not become an
official meditator. Life should be so molded that one will always have the
chance to think of Kåñëa. One should always act in such a way that all his daily
activities are in connection with Kåñëa. He should arrange his life in such a
way that throughout the twenty-four hours he cannot but think of Kåñëa. And the
Lord’s promise is that anyone who is in such pure Kåñëa consciousness will
certainly return to the abode of Kåñëa, where he will be engaged in the
association of Kåñëa face to face. This most confidential part of knowledge is
spoken to Arjuna because he is the dear friend of Kåñëa. Everyone who follows
the path of Arjuna can become a dear friend to Kåñëa and obtain the same
perfection as Arjuna.

These words stress that one should concentrate his mind upon Kåñëa—the very form
with two hands carrying a flute, the bluish boy with a beautiful face and
peacock feathers in His hair. There are descriptions of Kåñëa found in the
Brahma-saàhitä and other literatures. One should fix his mind on this original
form of Godhead, Kåñëa. He should not even divert his attention to other forms
of the Lord. The Lord has multi-forms, as Viñëu, Näräyaëa, Räma, Varäha, etc.,
but a devotee should concentrate his mind on the form that was present before
Arjuna. Concentration of the mind on the form of Kåñëa constitutes the most
confidential part of knowledge, and this is disclosed to Arjuna because Arjuna
is the most dear friend of Kåñëa’s.

TRANSLATION
Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver
you from all sinful reaction. Do not fear.

PURPORT
The Lord has described various kinds of knowledge, processes of religion,
knowledge of the Supreme Brahman, knowledge of the Supersoul, knowledge of the
different types of orders and statuses of social life, knowledge of the
renounced order of life, knowledge of nonattachment, sense and mind control,
meditation, etc. He has described in so many ways different types of religion.
Now, in summarizing Bhagavad-gétä, the Lord says that Arjuna should give up all
the processes that have been explained to him; he should simply surrender to
Kåñëa. That surrender will save him from all kinds of sinful reactions, for the
Lord personally promises to protect him.

In the Eighth Chapter it was said that only one who has become free from all
sinful reactions can take to the worship of Lord Kåñëa. Thus one may think that
unless he is free from all sinful reactions he cannot take to the surrendering
process. To such doubts it is here said that even if one is not free from all
sinful reactions, simply by the process of surrendering to Çré Kåñëa he is
automatically freed. There is no need of strenuous effort to free oneself from
sinful reactions. One should unhesitatingly accept Kåñëa as the supreme savior
of all living entities. With faith and love, one should surrender unto Him.

According to the devotional process, one should simply accept such religious
principles that will lead ultimately to the devotional service of the Lord. One
may perform a particular occupational duty according to his position in the
social order, but if by executing his duty one does not come to the point of
Kåñëa consciousness, all his activities are in vain.

Anything that does not lead to the perfectional stage of Kåñëa consciousness
should be avoided. One should be confident that in all circumstances Kåñëa will
protect him from all difficulties. There is no need of thinking how one should
keep the body and soul together. Kåñëa will see to that. One should always think
himself helpless and should consider Kåñëa the only basis for his progress in
life. As soon as one seriously engages himself in devotional service to the Lord
in full Kåñëa consciousness, at once he becomes freed from all contamination of
material nature. There are different processes of religion and purificatory
processes by cultivation of knowledge, meditation in the mystic yoga system,
etc., but one who surrenders unto Kåñëa does not have to execute so many
methods. That simple surrender unto Kåñëa will save him from unnecessarily
wasting time. One can thus make all progress at once and be freed from all
sinful reaction.

One should be attracted by the beautiful vision of Kåñëa. His name is Kåñëa
because He is all-attractive. One who becomes attracted by the beautiful,
all-powerful, omnipotent vision of Kåñëa is fortunate. There are different kinds
of transcendentalists—some of them are attached to the impersonal Brahman
vision, some of them are attracted by the Supersoul feature, etc., but one who
is attracted to the personal feature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and,
above all, one who is attracted by the Supreme Personality of Godhead as Kåñëa
Himself, is the most perfect transcendentalist. In other words, devotional
service to Kåñëa, in full consciousness, is the most confidential part of
knowledge, and this is the essence of the whole Bhagavad-gétä. Karma-yogés,
empiric philosophers, mystics, and devotees are all called transcendentalists,
but one who is a pure devotee is the best of all. The particular words used
here, mä çucaù, “Don’t fear, don’t hesitate, don’t worry,” are very significant.
One may be perplexed as to how one can give up all kinds of religious forms and
simply surrender unto Kåñëa, but such worry is useless.

TRANSLATION
This confidential knowledge may not be explained to those who are not austere,
or devoted, or engaged in devotional service, nor to one who is envious of Me.

PURPORT
Persons who have not undergone the austerities of the religious process, who
have never attempted devotional service in Kåñëa consciousness, who have not
tended a pure devotee, and especially those who are conscious of Kåñëa as a
historical personality or who are envious of the greatness of Kåñëa, should not
be told this most confidential part of knowledge. It is, however, sometimes
found that even demoniac persons who are envious of Kåñëa, worshiping Kåñëa in a
different way, take to the profession of explaining Bhagavad-gétä in a different
way to make business, but anyone who desires actually to understand Kåñëa must
avoid such commentaries on Bhagavad-gétä. Actually the purpose of Bhagavad-gétä
is not understandable to those who are sensuous—even if one is not sensuous but
is strictly following the disciplines enjoined in the Vedic scripture, if he is
not a devotee, he also cannot understand Kåñëa. Even when one poses himself as a
devotee of Kåñëa, but is not engaged in Kåñëa conscious activities, he also
cannot understand Kåñëa. There are many persons who envy Kåñëa because He has
explained in Bhagavad-gétä that He is the Supreme and that nothing is above Him
or equal to Him. There are many persons who are envious of Kåñëa. Such persons
should not be told of Bhagavad-gétä, for they cannot understand. There is no
possibility of faithless persons’ understanding Bhagavad-gétä and Kåñëa. Without
understanding Kåñëa from the authority of a pure devotee, one should not try to
comment upon Bhagavad-gitä.

TRANSLATION
For one who explains the supreme secret to the devotees, devotional service is
guaranteed, and at the end he will come back to Me.

PURPORT
Generally it is advised that Bhagavad-gétä be discussed amongst the devotees
only, for those who are not devotees will neither understand Kåñëa nor
Bhagavad-gétä. Those who do not accept Kåñëa as He is and Bhagavad-gétä as it is
should not try to explain Bhagavad-gétä whimsically and become offenders.
Bhagavad-gétä should be explained to persons who are ready to accept Kåñëa as
the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is a subject matter for the devotees only
and not for philosophical speculators. Anyone, however, who tries sincerely to
present Bhagavad-gétä as it is will advance in devotional activities and reach
the pure devotional state of life. As a result of such pure devotion, he is sure
to go back home, back to Godhead.

TRANSLATION
And one who listens with faith and without envy becomes free from sinful
reaction and attains to the planets where the pious dwell.

PURPORT
In the 67th verse of this chapter, the Lord explicitly forbade the Gétä’s being
spoken to those who are envious of the Lord. In other words, Bhagavad-gétä is
for the devotees only, but it so happens that sometimes a devotee of the Lord
will hold open class, and in that class all the students are not expected to be
devotees. Why do such persons hold open class? It is explained here that
although everyone is not a devotee, still there are many men who are not envious
of Kåñëa. They have faith in Him as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If such
persons hear from a bona fide devotee about the Lord, the result is that they
become at once free from all sinful reactions and after that attain to the
planetary system where all righteous persons are situated. Therefore simply by
hearing Bhagavad-gétä, even a person who does not try to be a pure devotee
attains the result of righteous activities. Thus a pure devotee of the Lord
gives everyone a chance to become free from all sinful reactions and to become a
devotee of the Lord.

Generally those who are free from sinful reaction are righteous. Such persons
very easily take to Kåñëa consciousness. The word puëya-karmaëäm is very
significant here. This refers to the performance of great sacrifice. Those who
are righteous in performing devotional service but who are not pure can attain
the planetary system of the polestar, or Dhruvaloka, where Dhruva Mahäräja is
presiding. He is a great devotee of the Lord, and he has a special planet which
is called the polestar.

TRANSLATION
O conqueror of wealth, Arjuna, have you heard this attentively with your mind?
And are your illusions and ignorance now dispelled?

PURPORT
The Lord was acting as the spiritual master of Arjuna. Therefore it was His duty
to inquire from Arjuna whether he understood the whole Bhagavad-gétä in its
proper perspective. If not, the Lord was ready to re-explain any point, or the
whole Bhagavad-gétä if so required. Actually, anyone who hears Bhagavad-gétä
from a bona fide spiritual master like Kåñëa or His representative will find
that all his ignorance is dispelled. Bhagavad-gétä is not an ordinary book
written by a poet or fiction writer; it is spoken by the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. Any person, if he is fortunate enough to hear these teachings from
Kåñëa or from His bona fide spiritual representative, is sure to become a
liberated person and get out of the darkness of ignorance.

Arjuna said, My dear Kåñëa, O infallible one, my illusion is now gone. I have

prepared to act according to Your instructions.

PURPORT
The constitutional position of a living entity, represented by Arjuna, is that
he has to act according to the order of the Supreme Lord. He is meant for
self-discipline. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu says that the actual position of the
living entity is that of eternal servant of the Supreme Lord. Forgetting this
principle, the living entity becomes conditioned by material nature, but in
serving the Supreme Lord, he becomes the liberated servant of God. The living
entity’s constitutional position is to be servitor; he either has to serve the
illusory mäyä or the Supreme Lord. If he serves the Supreme Lord, he is in his
normal condition, but if he prefers to serve the illusory external energy, then
certainly he will be in bondage. In illusion the living entity is serving in
this material world. He is bound by his lust and desires, yet he thinks of
himself as the master of the world. This is called illusion. When a person is
liberated, his illusion is over, and he voluntarily surrenders unto the Supreme
to act according to His desires. The last illusion, the last snare of mäyä to
trap the living entity, is the proposition that he is God. The living entity
thinks that he is no longer a conditioned soul, but God. He is so unintelligent
that he does not think that if he were God, then how could he be in doubt? That
he does not consider. So that is the last snare of illusion. Actually to become
free from the illusory energy is to understand Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, and agree to act according to His order. The word mohaù is very
important in this verse. Mohaù refers to that which is opposed to knowledge.
Actually real knowledge is the understanding that every living being is
eternally servitor of the Lord, but instead of thinking oneself in that
position, the living entity thinks that he is not servant, that he is the master
of this material world, for he wants to lord it over the material nature. That
is his illusion. This illusion can be overcome by the mercy of the Lord or by
the mercy of a pure devotee. When that illusion is over, one agrees to act in
Kåñëa consciousness.

Kåñëa consciousness is acting according to Kåñëa’s order. A conditioned soul
illusioned by the external energy of matter does not know that the Supreme Lord
is the master who is full of knowledge and who is the proprietor of everything.
Whatever He desires He can bestow upon His devotees; He is the friend of
everyone, and He is especially inclined to His devotee. He is the controller of
this material nature and of all living entities. He is also the controller of
inexhaustible time, and He is full of all opulences and all potencies. The
Supreme Personality of Godhead can even give Himself to the devotee. One who
does not know Him is under the spell of illusion; he does not become a devotee,
but a servitor of mäyä. Arjuna, however, after hearing Bhagavad-gétä from the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, became free from all illusion. He could
understand that Kåñëa was not only his friend, but the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. And he understood Kåñëa factually. So to study Bhagavad-gétä is to
understand Kåñëa factually. When a person is in full knowledge, he naturally
surrenders to Kåñëa. When Arjuna understood that it was Kåñëa’s plan to reduce
the unnecessary increase of population, he agreed to fight according to Kåñëa’s
desire. He again took up his weapons—his arrows and bow—to fight under the order
of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Saïjaya said: Thus have I heard the conversation of two great souls, Kåñëa and
Arjuna. And so wonderful is that message that my hair is standing on end.

PURPORT
In the beginning of Bhagavad-gétä, Dhåtaräñöra inquired from his secretary
Saïjaya, “What happened in the Battlefield of Kurukñetra?” The entire study was
related to the heart of Saïjaya by the grace of his spiritual master, Vyäsa. He
thus explained the theme of the battlefield. The conversation was wonderful
because such an important conversation between two great souls never took place
before and would not take place again. It is wonderful because the Supreme
Personality of Godhead is speaking about Himself and His energies to the living
entity, Arjuna, a great devotee of the Lord. If we follow in the footsteps of
Arjuna to understand Kåñëa, then our life will be happy and successful. Saïjaya
realized this, and as he began to understand it, he related the conversation to
Dhåtaräñöra. Now it is concluded that wherever there is Kåñëa and Arjuna, there
is victory.

TRANSLATION
By the mercy of Vyäsa, I have heard these most confidential talks directly from
the master of all mysticism, Kåñëa, who was speaking personally to Arjuna.

PURPORT
Vyäsa was the spiritual master of Saïjaya, and Saïjaya admits that it was by his
mercy that he could understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This means
that one has to understand Kåñëa not directly but through the medium of the
spiritual master. The spiritual master is the transparent medium, although it is
true that the experience is direct. This is the mystery of the disciplic
succession. When the spiritual master is bona fide, then one can hear
Bhagavad-gétä directly, as Arjuna heard it. There are many mystics and yogés all
over the world, but Kåñëa is the master of all yoga systems. Kåñëa’s instruction
is explicitly stated in Bhagavad-gétä—surrender unto Krñëa. One who does so is
the topmost yogé. This is confirmed in the last verse of the Sixth Chapter.
Yoginäm api sarveñäm.

Närada is the direct disciple of Kåñëa and the spiritual master of Vyäsa.
Therefore Vyäsa is as bona fide as Arjuna because he comes in the disciplic
succession, and Saïjaya is the direct disciple of Vyäsa. Therefore by the grace
of Vyäsa, his senses were purified, and he could see and hear Kåñëa directly.
One who directly hears Kåñëa can understand this confidential knowledge. If one
does not come to the disciplic succession, he cannot hear Kåñëa; therefore his
knowledge is always imperfect, at least as far as understanding Bhagavad-gétä is
concerned.

In Bhagavad-gétä, all the yoga systems, karma-yoga, jïäna-yoga and bhakti-yoga,
are explained. Kåñëa is the master of all such mysticism. It is to be
understood, however, that as Arjuna was fortunate enough to understand Kåñëa
directly, similarly, by the grace of Vyäsa, Saïjaya was also able to hear Kåñëa
directly. Actually there is no difference in hearing directly from Kåñëa or
hearing directly from Kåñëa via a bona fide spiritual master like Vyäsa. The
spiritual master is the representative of Vyäsadeva also. According to the Vedic
system, on the birthday of the spiritual master, the disciples conduct the
ceremony called Vyäsa-püjä.

O King, as I repeatedly recall this wondrous and holy dialogue between Kåñëa and

PURPORT
The understanding of Bhagavad-gétä is so transcendental that anyone who becomes
conversant with the topics of Arjuna and Kåñëa becomes righteous, and he cannot
forget such talks. This is the transcendental position of spiritual life. In
other words, one who hears the Gétä from the right source, directly from Kåñëa,
attains full Kåñëa consciousness. The result of Kåñëa consciousness is that one
becomes increasingly enlightened, and he enjoys life with a thrill, not only for
some time, but at every moment.

PURPORT
It appears that Saïjaya also, by the grace of Vyäsa, could see the universal
form of Kåñëa exhibited to Arjuna. It is, of course, said that Lord Kåñëa never
exhibited such a form before. It was exhibited to Arjuna only, yet some great
devotees could also see the universal form of Kåñëa when it was shown to Arjuna,
and Vyäsa was one of them. He is one of the great devotees of the Lord, and he
is considered to be a powerful incarnation of Kåñëa. Vyäsa disclosed this to his
disciple, Saïjaya, who remembered that wonderful form of Kåñëa exhibited to
Arjuna and enjoyed it repeatedly.

TRANSLATION
Wherever there is Kåñëa, the master of all mystics, and wherever there is
Arjuna, the supreme archer, there will also certainly be opulence, victory,
extraordinary power, and morality. That is my opinion.

PURPORT
The Bhagavad-gétä began with an inquiry of Dhåtaräñöra. He was hopeful of the
victory of his sons, assisted by great warriors like Bhéñma, Droëa and Karëa. He
was hopeful that the victory would be on his side. But, after describing the
scene in the battlefield, Saïjaya told the King, “You are thinking of victory,
but my opinion is that where Kåñëa and Arjuna are present, there will be all
good fortune.” He directly confirmed that Dhåtaräñöra could not expect victory
for his side. Victory was certain for the side of Arjuna because Kåñëa was
there. Kåñëa’s acceptance of the post of charioteer for Arjuna was an exhibition
of another opulence. Kåñëa is full of all opulences, and renunciation is one of
them. There are many instances of such renunciation, for Kåñëa is also the
master of renunciation.

The fight was actually between Duryodhana and Yudhiñöhira. Arjuna was fighting
on behalf of his elder brother, Yudhiñöhira. Because Kåñëa and Arjuna were on
the side of Yudhiñöhira, Yudhiñöhira’s victory was certain. The battle was to
decide who would rule the world, and Saïjaya predicted that the power would be
transferred to Yudhiñöhira. It is also predicted here that Yudhiñöhira, after
gaining victory in this battle, would flourish more and more because he was not
only righteous and pious, but he was a strict moralist. He never spoke a lie
during his life.

There are many less intelligent persons who take Bhagavad-gétä to be a
discussion of topics between two friends in a battlefield. But such a book
cannot be scripture. Some may protest that Kåñëa incited Arjuna to fight, which
is immoral, but the reality of the situation is clearly stated: Bhagavad-gétä is
the supreme instruction in morality. The supreme instruction of morality is
stated in the Ninth Chapter, in the thirty-fourth verse: manmanä bhava
mad-bhaktaù. One must become a devotee of Kåñëa, and the essence of all religion
is to surrender unto Kåñëa, as stated, Sarva-dharmän. The instructions of
Bhagavad-gétä constitute the supreme process of religion and of morality. All
other processes may be purifying and may lead to this process, but the last
instruction of the Gétä is the last word in all morality and religion: surrender
unto Kåñëa. This is the verdict of the Eighteenth Chapter.

From Bhagavad-gétä we can understand that to realize oneself by philosophical
speculation and by meditation is one process, but to fully surrender unto Kåñëa
is the highest perfection. This is the essence of the teachings of
Bhagavad-gétä. The path of regulative principles according to the orders of
social life and according to the different courses of religion may be a
confidential path of knowledge in as far as the rituals of religion are
confidential, but one is still involved with meditation and cultivation of
knowledge. Surrender unto Kåñëa in devotional service in full Kåñëa
consciousness is the most confidential instruction and is the essence of the
Eighteenth Chapter.

Another feature of Bhagavad-gétä is that the actual truth is the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa. Absolute Truth is realized in three
features—impersonal Brahman, localized Paramätmä, and the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, Kåñëa. Perfect knowledge of the Absolute Truth means perfect knowledge
of Kåñëa. If one understands Kåñëa, then all the departments of knowledge are
part and parcel of that understanding. Kåñëa is transcendental, for He is always
situated in His eternal internal potency. The living entities are manifested and
are divided into two classes, eternally conditioned and eternally liberated.
Such living entities are innumerable, and they are considered fundamental parts
of Kåñëa. Material energy is manifested into twenty-four divisions. The creation
is effected by eternal time, and it is created and dissolved by external energy.
This manifestation of the cosmic world repeatedly becomes visible and invisible.

In Bhagavad-gétä five principal subject matters have been discussed: the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, material nature, the living entities, eternal time and
all kinds of activities. All of these are dependant on the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, Kåñëa. All conceptions of the Absolute Truth, namely, impersonal
Brahman, localized Paramätmä, or any other transcendental conception, exist
within the category of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Although superficially the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the living entity,
material nature and time appear to be different, nothing is different from the
Supreme. But the Supreme is always different from everything. Lord Caitanya’s
philosophy is that of “inconceivably one and different.” This system of
philosophy constitutes perfect knowledge of the Absolute Truth.

The living entity in his original position is pure spirit. He is just like an
atomic particle of the Supreme Spirit. The conditioned living entity, however,
is the marginal energy of the Lord; he tends to be in contact with both the
material energy and the spiritual energy. In other words, the living entity is
situated between the two energies of the Lord, and because he belongs to the
superior energy of the Lord, he has a particle of independence. By proper use of
that independence he comes under the direct order of Kåñëa. Thus he attains his
normal condition in the pleasure-giving potency.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Eighteenth Chapter of the
Çrémad-Bhagavad-gétä in the matter of its Conclusions—the Perfection of
Renunciation.
