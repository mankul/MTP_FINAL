Karma Yoga
A book by Swami Vivekananda

Based on lectures the Swami delivered in his rented rooms at 228 W
39th Street in December, 1895 and January, 1896. The classes were
free of charge. Generally the Swami held two classes daily- morning
and evening.
Although the Swami delivered many lectures and held numerous classes
in the two years and five months he had been in America, these lectures
constituted a departure in the way they were recorded. Just prior to the
commencement of his Winter -95-96 season in NYC, his friends and
supporters aided him by advertising for and ultimately hiring a
professional stenographer: The man selected, Joseph Josiah Goodwin,
later became a disciple of the Swami and followed him to England and
India.

Karma in its effect on
character

Karma Yoga

The word Karma is derived from the Sanskrit Kri, to do; all action
is Karma. Technically, this word also means the effects of actions.
In connection with metaphysics, it sometimes means the effects,
of which our past actions were the causes. But in Karma-Yoga we
have simply to do with the word Karma as meaning work. The
goal of mankind is knowledge. That is the one ideal placed before
us by Eastern philosophy. Pleasure is not the goal of man, but
knowledge. Pleasure and happiness come to an end. It is a mistake
to suppose that pleasure is the goal. The cause of all the miseries
we have in the world is that men foolishly think pleasure to be the
ideal to strive for. After a time man finds that it is not happiness,
but knowledge, towards which he is going, and that both pleasure
and pain are great teachers, and that he learns as much from evil
as from good. As pleasure and pain pass before his soul they have
upon it different pictures, and the result of these combined
impressions is what is called man's "character". If you take the
character of any man, it really is but the aggregate of tendencies,
the sum total of the bent of his mind; you will find that misery and
happiness are equal factors in the formation of that character.
Good and evil have an equal share in moulding character, and in
some instances misery is a greater teacher than happiness. In
studying the great characters the world has produced, I dare say, in
the vast majority of cases, it would be found that it was misery
that taught more than happiness, it was poverty that taught more
than wealth, it was blows that brought out their inner fire more
than praise.
Now this knowledge, again, is inherent in man. No knowledge
comes from outside; it is all inside. What we say a man "knows",
should, in strict psychological language, be what he "discovers" or
"unveils"; what a man "learns" is really what he "discovers", by
taking the cover off his own soul, which is a mine of infinite

knowledge.
We say Newton discovered gravitation. Was it sitting anywhere in
a corner waiting for him? It was in his own mind; the time came
and he found it out. All knowledge that the world has ever
received comes from the mind; the infinite library of the universe
is in your own mind. The external world is simply the suggestion,
the occasion, which sets you to study your own mind, but the
object of your study is always your own mind. The falling of an
apple gave the suggestion to Newton, and he studied his own
mind. He rearranged all the previous links of thought in his mind
and discovered a new link among them, which we call the law of
gravitation. It was not in the apple nor in anything in the centre of
the earth.
All knowledge, therefore, secular or spiritual, is in the human
mind. In many cases it is not discovered, but remains covered, and
when the covering is being slowly taken off, we say, "We are
learning," and the advance of knowledge is made by the advance
of this process of uncovering. The man from whom this veil is
being lifted is the more knowing man, the man upon whom it lies
thick is ignorant, and the man from whom it has entirely gone is
all-knowing, omniscient. There have been omniscient men, and, I
believe, there will be yet; and that there will be myriads of them in
the cycles to come. Like fire in a piece of flint, knowledge exists
in the mind; suggestion is the friction which brings it out. So with
all our feelings and actions--our tears and our smiles, our joys and
our griefs, our weeping and our laughter, our curses and our
blessings, our praises and our blames--every one of these we may
find, if we calmly study our own selves, to have been brought out
from within ourselves by so many blows. The result is what we
are. All these blows taken together are called Karma--work,
action. Every mental and physical blow that is given to the soul,
by which, as it were, fire is struck from it, and by which its own

power and knowledge are discovered, is Karma, this word being
used in its widest sense. Thus we are all doing Karma all the time.
I am talking to you: that is Karma. You are listening: that is
Karma. We breathe: that is Karma. We walk: Karma. Everything
we do, physical or mental, is Karma, and it leaves its marks on us.
There are certain works which are, as it were, the aggregate, the
sum total, of a large number of smaller works. If we stand near the
seashore and hear the waves dashing against the shingle, we think
it is such a great noise, and yet we know that one wave is really
composed of millions and millions of minute waves. Each one of
these is making a noise, and yet we do not catch it; it is only when
they become the big aggregate that we hear. Similarly, every
pulsation of the heart is work. Certain kinds of work we feel and
they become tangible to us; they are, at the same time, the
aggregate of a number of small works. If you really want to judge
of the character of a man, look not at his great performances.
Every fool may become a hero at one time or another. Watch a
man do his most common actions; those are indeed the things
which will tell you the real character of a great man. Great
occasions rouse even the lowest of human beings to some kind of
greatness, but he alone is the really great man whose character is
great always, the same wherever he be.
Karma in its effect on character is the most tremendous power
than man has to deal with. Man is, as it were, a centre, and is
attracting all the powers of the universe towards himself, and in
this centre is fusing them all and again sending them off in a big
current. Such a centre is the real man--the almighty, the
omniscient--and he draws the whole universe towards him. Good
and bad, misery and happiness, all are running towards him and
clinging round him; and out of them he fashions the mighty stream
of tendency called character and throws it outwards. As he has the
power of drawing in anything, so has he the power of throwing it

out.
All the actions that we see in the world, all the movements in
human society, all the works that we have around us, are simply
the display of thought, the manifestation of the will of man.
Machines or instruments, cities, ships, or men-of-war, all these are
simply the manifestation of the will of man; and this will is caused
by character, and character is manufactured by Karma. As is
Karma, so is the manifestation of the will. The men of mighty will
the world has produced have all been tremendous workers-gigantic souls, with wills powerful enough to overturn worlds,
wills they got by persistent work, through ages, and ages. Such a
gigantic will as that of a Buddha or a Jesus could not be obtained
in one life, for we know who their fathers were. It is not known
that their fathers ever spoke a word for the good of mankind.
Millions and millions of carpenters like Joseph had gone; millions
are still living. Millions and millions of petty kings like Buddha's
father had been in the world. If it was only a case of hereditary
transmission, how do you account for this petty prince, who was
not, perhaps, obeyed by his own servants, producing this son,
whom half a world worships? How do you explain the gulf
between the carpenter and his son, whom millions of human
beings worship as God? It cannot be solved by the theory of
heredity. The gigantic will which Buddha and Jesus threw over the
world, whence did it come? Whence came this accumulation of
power? It must have been there through ages and ages, continually
growing bigger and
bigger, until it burst on society in a Buddha or a Jesus, even
rolling down to the present day.
All this is determined by Karma, work. No one can get anything
unless he earns it. This is an eternal law. We may sometimes think
it is not so, but in the long run we become convinced of it. A man

may struggle all his life for riches; he may cheat thousands, but he
finds at last that he did not deserve to become rich, and his life
becomes a trouble and a nuisance to him. We may go on
accumulating things for our physical enjoyment, but only what we
earn is really ours. A fool may buy all the books in the world, and
they will be in his library; but he will be able to read only those
that he deserves to; and this deserving is produced by Karma. Our
Karma determines what we deserve and what we can assimilate.
We are responsible for what we are; and whatever we wish
ourselves to be, we have the power to make ourselves. If what we
are now has been the result of our own past actions, it certainly
follows that whatever we wish to be in future can be produced by
our present actions; so we have to know how to act. You will say,
"What is the use of learning how to work? Everyone works in
some way or other in this world." But there is such a thing as
frittering away our energies. With regard to Karma-Yoga, the Gita
says that it is doing work with cleverness and as a science; by
knowing how to work, one can obtain the greatest results. You
must remember that all work is simply to bring out the power of
the mind which is already there, to wake up the soul. The power is
inside every man, so is knowing; the different works are like
blows to bring them out, to cause these giants to wake up.
Man works with various motives. There cannot be work without
motive. Some people want to get fame, and they work for fame.
Others want money, and they work for money. Others want to
have power, and they work for power. Others want to get to
heaven, and they work for the same. Others want to leave a name
when they die, as they do in China, where no man gets a title until
he is dead; and that is a better way, after all, than with us. When a
man does something very good there, they give a title of nobility
to his father, who is dead, or to his grandfather. Some people work
for that. Some of the followers of certain Mohammedan sects
work all their lives to have a big tomb built for them when they
file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Selv...ivekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (7 of 88)2/25/2007 9:26:35 PM

Karma Yoga

die. I know sects among whom, as soon as a child is born, a tomb
is prepared for it; that is among them the most important work a
man has to do, and the bigger and the finer the tomb, the better off
the man is supposed to be. Others work as a penance; do all sorts
of wicked things, then erect a temple, or give something to the
priests to buy them off and obtain from them a passport to heaven.
They think that this kind of beneficence will clear them and they
will go scot-free in spite of their sinfulness. Such are some of the
various motives for work.
Work for work's sake. There are some who are really the salt of
the earth in every country and who work for work's sake, who do
not care for name, or fame, or even to go to heaven. They work
just because good will come of it. There are others who do good to
the poor and help mankind from still higher motives, because they
believe in doing good and love good. The motive for name and
fame seldom brings immediate results, as a rule; they come to us
when we are old and have almost done with life. If a man works
without any selfish motive in view, does he not gain anything?
Yes, he gains the highest. Unselfishness is more paying, only
people have not the patience to practise it. It is more paying from
the point of view of health also. Love, truth and unselfishness are
not merely moral figures of speech, but they form our highest
ideal, because in them lies such a manifestation of power. In the
first place, a man who can work for five days, or even for five
minutes, without any selfish motive whatever, without thinking of
future, of heaven, of punishment, or anything of the kind, has in
him the capacity to become a powerful moral giant. It is hard to do
it, but in the heart of our hearts we know its value, and the good it
brings. It is the greatest manifestation of power--this tremendous
restraint; self-restraint is a manifestation of greater power than all
outgoing action. A carriage with four horses may rush down a hill
unrestrained, or the coachman may curb the horses. Which is the
greater manifestation of power, to let them go or to hold them? A
file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Selv...ivekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (8 of 88)2/25/2007 9:26:35 PM

Karma Yoga

cannon-ball flying through the air goes a long distance and falls.
Another is cut short in its flight by striking against a wall, and the
impact generates intense heat. All outgoing energy following a
selfish motive is frittered away; it will not cause power to return to
you; but if restrained, it will result in development of power. This
self-control will tend to produce a mighty will, a character which
makes a Christ or a Buddha. Foolish men do not know this secret;
they nevertheless want to rule mankind. Even a fool may rule the
whole world if he works and waits. Let him wait a few years,
restrain that foolish idea of governing; and when that idea is
wholly gone, he will be a power in the world. The majority of us
cannot see beyond a few years, just as some animals cannot see
beyond a few steps. Just a little narrow circle--that is our world.
We have not the patience to look beyond, and thus become
immoral and wicked. This is our weakness, our powerlessness.
Even the lowest forms of work are not to be despised. Let the
man, who knows no better, work for selfish ends, for name and
fame; but everyone should always try to get towards higher and
higher motives and to understand them. "To work we have the
right, but not to the fruits thereof." Leave the fruits alone. Why
care for results? If you wish to help a man, never think what that
man's attitude should be towards you. If you want to do a great or
a good work, do not trouble to think what the result will be.
There arises a difficult question in this ideal of work. Intense
activity is necessary; we must always work. We cannot live a
minute without work. What then becomes of rest? Here is one side
of the life-struggle--work, in which we are whirled rapidly round.
And here is the other--that of calm, retiring renunciation:
everything is peaceful around, there is very little of noise and
show, only nature with her animals and flowers and mountains.
Neither of them is a perfect picture. A man used to solitude, if
brought in contact with the surging whirlpool of the world, will be
file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Selv...ivekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (9 of 88)2/25/2007 9:26:35 PM

Karma Yoga

crushed by it; just as the fish that lives in the deep sea water, as
soon as it is brought to the surface, breaks into pieces, deprived of
the weight of water on it that had kept it together. Can a man who
has been used to the turmoil and the rush of life live at ease if he
comes to a quiet place? He suffers and perchance may lose his
mind. The ideal man is he who, in the midst of the greatest silence
and solitude, finds the intensest activity, and in the midst of the
intensest activity finds the silence and solitude of the desert. He
has learnt the secret of restraint, he has controlled himself. He
goes through the streets of a big city with all its traffic, and his
mind is as calm as if he were in a cave, where not a sound could
reach him; and he is intensely working all the time. That is the
ideal of Karma- Yoga, and if you have attained to that you have
really learnt the secret of work.
But we have to begin from the beginning, to take up the works as
they come to us and slowly make ourselves more unselfish every
day. We must do the work and find out the motive power that
prompts us; and, almost without exception, in the first years, we
shall find that our motives are always selfish; but gradually this
selfishness will melt by persistence, till at last will come the time
when we shall be able to do really unselfish work. We may all
hope that some day or other, as we struggle through the paths of
life, there will come a time when we shall become perfectly
unselfish; and the moment we attain to that, all our powers will be
concentrated, and the knowledge which is ours will be manifest.

CHAPTER 2
Each is great in his own place
According to the Sankhya philosophy, nature is composed of three
forces called, in Sanskrit, Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas. These as
manifested in the physical world are what we may call
equilibrium, activity, and inertness. Tamas is typified as darkness
or inactivity; Rajas is activity, expressed as attraction or repulsion;
and Sattva is the equilibrium of the two. In every man there are
these three forces. Sometimes Tamas prevails. We become lazy,
we cannot move, we are inactive, bound down by certain ideas or
by mere dullness. At other times activity prevails, and at still other
times that calm balancing of both. Again, in different men, one of
these forces is generally predominant. The characteristic of one
man is inactivity, dullness and laziness; that of another, activity,
power, manifestation of energy; and in still another we find the
sweetness, calmness, and gentleness, which are due to the
balancing of both action and inaction. So in all creation--in
animals, plants, and men--we find the more or less typical
manifestation of all these different forces.
Karma-Yoga has specially to deal with these three factors. By
teaching what they are and how to employ them, it helps us to do
our work better. Human society is a graded organisation. We all
know about morality, and we all know about duty, but at the same
time we find that in different countries the significance of
morality varies greatly. What is regarded as moral in one country
may in another be considered perfectly immoral. For instance, in
one country cousins may marry; in another, it is thought to be very
immoral; in one, men may marry their sisters-in-law; in another, it
is regarded as immoral; in one country people may marry only
file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (11 of 88)2/25/2007 9:26:35 PM

Karma Yoga

once; in another, many times; and so forth. Similarly, in all other
departments of morality, we find the standard varies greatly- yet
we have the idea that there must be a universal standard of
morality.
So it is with duty. The idea of duty varies much among different
nations. In one country, if a man does not do certain things, people
will say he has acted wrongly; while if he does those very things
in another country, people will say that he did not act rightly--and
yet we know that there must be some universal idea of duty. In the
same way, one class of society thinks that certain things are
among its duty, while another class thinks quite the opposite and
would be horrified if it had to do those things. Two ways are left
open to us--the way of the ignorant, who think that there is only
one way to truth and that all the rest are wrong, and the way of the
wise, who admit that, according to our mental constitution or the
different planes of existence in which we are, duty and morality
may vary. The important thing is to know that there are gradations
of duty and of morality--that the duty of one state of life, in one
set of circumstances, will not and cannot be that of another.
To illustrate: All great teachers have taught, "Resist not evil," that
non-resistance is the highest moral ideal. We all know that, if a
certain number of us attempted to put that maxim fully into
practice, the whole social fabric would fall to pieces, the wicked
would take possession of our properties and our lives, and would
do whatever they like with us. Even if only one day of such nonresistance were practised, it would lead to disaster. Yet,
intuitively, in our heart of hearts we feel the truth of the teaching
"Resist not evil." This seems to us to be the highest ideal; yet to
teach this doctrine only would be equivalent to condemning a vast
portion of mankind. Not only so, it would be making men feel that
they were always doing wrong, and cause in them scruples of
conscience in all their actions; it would weaken them, and that
file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (12 of 88)2/25/2007 9:26:35 PM

Karma Yoga

constant self-disapproval would breed more vice than any other
weakness would. To the man who has begun to hate himself the
gate to degeneration has already opened; and the same is true of a
nation. Our first duty is not to hate ourselves, because to advance
we must have faith in ourselves first and then in God. He who has
no faith in himself can never have faith in God. Therefore, the
only alternative remaining to us is to recognise that duty and
morality vary under different circumstances; not that the man who
resists evil is doing what is always and in itself wrong, but that in
the different circumstances in which he is placed it may become
even his duty to resist evil.
In reading the Bhagavad-Gita, many of you in Western countries
may have felt astonished at the second chapter, wherein Sri
Krishna calls Arjuna a hypocrite and a coward because of his
refusal to fight, or offer resistance, on account of his adversaries
being his friends and relatives, making the plea that non-resistance
was the highest ideal of love. This is a great lesson for us all to
learn, that in all matters the two extremes are alike. The extreme
positive and the extreme negative are always similar. When the
vibrations of light are too slow, we do not see them, nor do we see
them when they are too rapid. So with sound; when very low in
pitch, we do not hear it; when very high, we do not hear it either.
Of like nature is the difference between resistance and nonresistance. One man does not resist because he is weak, lazy, and
cannot, not because he will not; the other man knows that he can
strike an irresistible blow if he likes; yet he not only does not
strike, but blesses his enemies. The one who from weakness
resists not commits a sin, and as such cannot receive any benefit
from the non-resistance; while the other would commit a sin by
offering resistance. Buddha gave up his throne and renounced his
position, that was true renunciation; but there cannot be any
question of renunciation in the case of a beggar who has nothing
to renounce. So we must always be careful about what we really
file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (13 of 88)2/25/2007 9:26:35 PM

Karma Yoga

mean when we speak of this non-resistance and ideal love. We
must first take care to understand whether we have the power of
resistance or not. Then, having the power, if we renounce it and
do not resist, we are doing a grand act of love; but if we cannot
resist, and yet, at the same time, try to deceive ourselves into the
belief that we are actuated by motives of the highest love, we are
doing the exact opposite. Arjuna became a coward at the sight of
the mighty array against him; his "love" make him forget his duty
towards his country and king. That is why Sri Krishna told him
that he was a hypocrite; Thou talkest like a wise man, but thy
actions betray thee to be a coward; therefore stand up and fight!
Such is the central idea of Karma-Yoga. The Karma-Yogi is the
man who understands that the highest ideal is non-resistance, and
who also knows that this non-resistance is the highest
manifestation of power in actual possession, and also what is
called the resisting of evil is but a step on the way towards the
manifestation of this highest power, namely, non-resistance.
Before reaching this highest ideal, man's duty is to resist evil; let
him work, let him fight, let him strike straight from the shoulder.
Then only, when he has gained the power to resist, will nonresistance be a virtue.
I once met a man in my country whom I had known before as a
very stupid, dull person, who knew nothing and had not the desire
to know anything, and was living the life of a brute. He asked me
what he should do to know God, how he was to get free. "Can you
tell a lie?" I asked him. "No," he replied. "Then you must learn to
do so. It is better to tell a lie than to be a brute, or a log of wood.
You are inactive; you have not certainly reached the highest state,
which is beyond all actions, calm and serene; you are too dull
even to do something wicked." That was an extreme case, of
course, and I was joking with him; but what I meant was that a
man must be active in order to pass through activity to perfect
file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (14 of 88)2/25/2007 9:26:35 PM

Karma Yoga

calmness.
Inactivity should be avoided by all means. Activity always means
resistance. Resist all evils, mental and physical; and when you
have succeeded in resisting, then will calmness come. It is very
easy to say, "Hate nobody, resist not evil," but we know what that
kind of thing generally means in practice. When the eyes of
society are turned towards us, we may make a show of nonresistance, but in our hearts it is canker all the time. We feel the
utter want of the calm of non-resistance; we feel that it would be
better for us to resist. If you desire wealth, and know at the same
time that the whole world regards him who aims at wealth as a
very wicked man, you, perhaps, will not dare to plunge into the
struggle for wealth, yet your mind will be running day and night
after money. This is hypocrisy and will serve no purpose. Plunge
into the world, and then, after a time, when you have suffered and
enjoyed all that is in it, will renunciation come; then will calmness
come. So fulfil your desire for power and everything else, and
after you have fulfilled the desire, will come the time when you
will know that they are all very little things; but until you have
fulfilled this desire, until you have passed through that activity, it
is impossible for you to come to the state of calmness, serenity,
and self-surrender. These ideas of serenity and renunciation have
been preached for thousands of years; everybody has heard of
them from childhood, and yet we see very few in the world who
have really reached that stage. I do not know if I have seen twenty
persons in my life who are really calm and non-resisting, and I
have travelled over half the world.
Every man should take up his own ideal and endeavour to
accomplish it. That is a surer way of progress than taking up other
men's ideals, which he can never hope to accomplish. For
instance, we take a child and at once give him the task of walking
twenty miles. Either the little one dies, or one in a thousand crawls
file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (15 of 88)2/25/2007 9:26:35 PM

Karma Yoga

the twenty miles, to reach the end exhausted and half-dead. That is
like what we generally try to do with the world. All the men and
women, in any society, are not of the same mind, capacity, or of
the same power to do things; they must have different ideals, and
we have no right to sneer at any ideal. Let every one do the best
he can for realising his own ideal. Nor is it right that I should be
judged by your standard or you by mine. The apple tree should not
be judged by the standard of the oak, nor the oak by that of the
apple. To judge the apple tree you must take the apple standard,
and for the oak, its own standard.
Unity in variety is the plan of creation. However men and women
may vary individually, there is unity in the background. The
different individual characters and classes of men and women are
natural variations in creation. Hence, we ought not to judge them
by the same standard or put the same ideal before them. Such a
course creates only an unnatural struggle, and the result is that
man begins to hate himself and is hindered from becoming
religious and good. Our duty is to encourage every one in his
struggle to live up to his own highest ideal, and strive at the same
time to make the ideal as near as possible to the truth.
In the Hindu system of morality we find that this fact has been
recognised from very ancient times; and in their scriptures and
books on ethics different rules are laid down for the different
classes of men--the householder, the Sannyasin (the man who has
renounced the world), and the student.
The life of every individual, according to the Hindu scriptures, has
its peculiar duties apart from what belongs in common to
universal humanity. The Hindu begins life as a student; then he
marries and becomes a householder; in old age he retires; and

these stages of life certain duties are attached. No one of these

stages is intrinsically superior to another. The life of the married
man is quite as great as that of the celibate who has devoted
himself to religious work. The scavenger in the street is quite as
great and glorious as the king on his throne. Take him off his
throne, make him do the work of the scavenger, and see how he
fares. Take up the scavenger and see how he will rule. It is useless
to say that the man who lives out of the world is a greater man
than he who lives in the world; it is much more difficult to live in
the world and worship God than to give it up and live a free and
easy life. The four stages of life in India have in later times been
reduced to two--that of the householder and of the monk. The
householder marries and carries on his duties as a citizen, and the
duty of the other is to devote his energies wholly to religion, to
preach and to worship God. I shall read to you a few passages
from the Maha-Nirvana-Tantra, which treats of this subject, and
you will see that it is a very difficult task for a man to be a
householder, and perform all his duties perfectly:
The householder should be devoted to God; the knowledge of God
should be his goal of life. Yet he must work constantly, perform
all his duties; he must give up the fruits of his actions to God. It is
the most difficult thing in this world to work and not care for the
result, to help a man and never think that he ought to be grateful,
to do some good work and at the same time never look to see
whether it brings you name or fame, or nothing at all. Even the
most arrant coward becomes brave when the world praises him. A
fool can do heroic deeds when the approbation of society is upon
him, but for a man to constantly do good without caring for the
approbation of his fellow men is indeed the highest sacrifice man
can perform. The great duty of the householder is to earn a living,
but he must take care that he does not do it by telling lies, or by
cheating, or by robbing others; and he must remember that his life
is for the service of God, and the poor.

Knowing that mother and father are the visible representatives of
God, the householder, always and by all means, must please them.
If the mother is pleased, and the father, God is pleased with the
man. That child is really a good child who never speaks harsh
words to his parents.
Before parents one must not utter jokes, must not show
restlessness, must not show anger or temper. Before mother or
father, a child must bow down low, and stand up in their presence,
and must not take a seat until they order him to sit.
If the householder has food and drink and clothes without first
seeing that his mother and his father, his children, his wife, and
the poor, are supplied, he is committing a sin. The mother and the
father are the causes of this body; so a man must undergo a
thousand troubles in order to do good to them.
Even so is his duty to his wife. No man should scold his wife, and
he must always maintain her as if she were his own mother. And
even when he is in the greatest difficulties and troubles, he must
not show anger to his wife.
He who thinks of another woman besides his wife, if he touches
her even with his mind--that man goes to dark hell.
Before women he must not talk improper language, and never
brag of his powers. He must not say, "I have done this, and I have
done that."
The householder must always please his wife with money, clothes,
love, faith, and words like nectar, and never do anything to disturb
her. That man who has succeeded in getting the love of a chaste
wife has succeeded in his religion and has all the virtues.
The following are duties towards children:

A son should be lovingly reared up to his fourth year; he should
be educated till he is sixteen. When he is twenty years of age he
should be employed in some work; he should then be treated
affectionately by his father as his equal. Exactly in the same
manner the daughter should be brought up, and should be
educated with the greatest care. And when she marries, the father
ought to give her jewels and wealth.
Then the duty of the man is towards his brothers and sisters, and
towards the children of his brothers and sisters, if they are poor,
and towards his other relatives, his friends and his servants. Then
his duties are towards the people of the same village, and the poor,
and any one that comes to him for help. Having sufficient means,
if the householder does not take care to give to his relatives and to
the poor, know him to be only a brute; his is not a human being.
Excessive attachment to food, clothes, and the tending of the
body, and dressing of the hair should be avoided. The householder
must be pure in heart and clean in body, always active and always
ready for work.
To his enemies the householder must be a hero. Them he must
resist. That is the duty of the householder. He must not sit down in
a corner and weep, and talk nonsense about non-resistance. If he
does not show himself a hero to his enemies he has not done his
duty. And to his friends and relatives he must be as gentle as a
lamb.
It is the duty of the householder not to pay reverence to the
wicked; because, if he reverences the wicked people of the world,
he patronises wickedness; and it will be a great mistake if he
disregards those who are worthy of respect, the good people. He
must not be gushing in his friendship; he must not go out of the
way making friends everywhere; he must watch the actions of the

men he wants to make friends with, and their dealings with other
men, reason upon them, and then make friends.
These three things he must not talk of. He must not talk in public
of his own fame; he must not preach his own name or his own
powers; he must not talk of his wealth, or of anything that has
been told to him privately.
A man must not say he is poor, or that he is wealthy--he must not
brag of his wealth. Let him keep his own counsel; this is his
religious duty. This is not mere worldly wisdom; if a man does not
do so, he may be held to be immoral.
The householder is the basis, the prop, of the whole society. He is
the principal earner. The poor, the weak, the children and the
women who do not work--all live upon the householder; so there
must be certain duties that he has to perform, and these duties
must make him feel strong to perform them, and not make him
think that he is doing things beneath his ideal. Therefore, if he has
done something weak, or has made some mistake, he must not say
so in public; and if he is engaged in some enterprise and knows he
is sure to fail in it, he must not speak of it. Such self-exposure is
not only uncalled for, but also unnerves the man and makes him
unfit for the performance of his legitimate duties in life. At the
same time, he must struggle hard to acquire these things--firstly,
knowledge, and secondly, wealth. It is his duty, and if he does not
do his duty, he is nobody. A householder who does not struggle to
get wealth is immoral. If he is lazy and content to lead an idle life,
he is immoral, because upon him depend hundreds. If he gets
riches, hundreds of others will be thereby supported.
If there were not in this city hundreds who had striven to become
rich, and who had acquired wealth, where would all this
civilisation, and these alms-houses and great houses be?

Karma Yoga

Going after wealth in such a case is not bad, because that wealth is
for distribution. The householder is the centre of life and society.
It is a worship for him to acquire and spend wealth nobly, for the
householder who struggles to become rich by good means and for
good purposes is doing practically the same thing for the
attainment of salvation as the anchorite does in his cell when he is
praying; for in them we see only the different aspects of the same
virtue of self-surrender and self-sacrifice prompted by the feeling
of devotion to God and to all that is His.
He must struggle to acquire a good name by all means. He must
not gamble, he must not move in the company of the wicked, he
must not tell lies, and must not be the cause of trouble to others.
Often people enter into things they have not the means to
accomplish, with the result that they cheat others to attain their
own ends. Then there is in all things the time factor to be taken
into consideration; what at one time might be a failure, would
perhaps at another time be a very great success.
The householder must speak the truth, and speak gently, using
words which people like, which will do good to others; nor should
he talk of the business of other men.
The householder by digging tanks, by planting trees on the
roadsides, by establishing rest-houses for men and animals, by
making roads and building bridges, goes towards the same goal as
the greatest Yogi. This is one part of the doctrine of Karma-Yoga-activity, the duty of the householder. There is a passage later on,
where it says that "if the householder dies in battle, fighting for
his country or his religion, he comes to the same goal as the Yogi
by meditation," showing thereby that what is duty for one is not
duty for another. At the same time, it does not say that this duty is
lowering and the other elevating. Each duty has its own place, and

Karma Yoga

according to the circumstances in which we are placed, must we
perform our duties.
One idea comes out of all this--the condemnation of all weakness.
This is a particular idea in all our teachings which I like, either in
philosophy, or in religion, or in work. If you read the Vedas, you
will find this word always repeated--fearlessness--fear nothing.
Fear is a sign of weakness. A man must go about his duties
without taking notice of the sneers and the ridicule of the world.
If a man retires from the world to worship God, he must not think
that those who live in the world and work for the good of the
world are not worshipping God: neither must those who live in the
world, for wife and children, think that those who give up the
world are low vagabonds. Each is great in his own place. This
thought I will illustrate by a story.
A certain king used to inquire of all the Sannyasins that came to
his country, "Which is the greater man--he who gives up the world
and becomes a Sannyasin, or he who lives in the world and
performs his duties as a householder?" Many wise men sought to
solve the problem. Some asserted that the Sannyasin was the
greater, upon which the king demanded that they should prove
their assertion. When they could not, he ordered them to marry
and become householders. Then others came and said, "The
householder who performs his duties is the greater man." Of them,
too the king demanded proofs. When they could not give them, he
made them also settle down as householders.
At last there came a young Sannyasin, and the king similarly
inquired of him also. He answered, "Each, O king, is equally great
in his place." "Prove this to me," asked the king. "I will prove it to
you," said the Sannyasin, "but you must first come and live as I do
for a few days, that I may be able to prove to you what I say." The

king consented and followed the Sannyasin out of his own
territory and passed through many other countries until they came
to a great kingdom. In the capital of that kingdom a great
ceremony was going on. The king and the Sannyasin heard the
noise of drums and music, and heard also the criers; the people
were assembled in the streets in gala dress, and a great
proclamation was being made. The king and the Sannyasin stood
there to see what was going on. The crier was proclaiming loudly
that the princess, daughter of the king of that country, was about
to choose a husband from among those assembled before her.
It was an old custom in India for princesses to choose husbands in
this way. Each princess had certain ideas of the sort of man she
wanted for a husband. Some would have the handsomest man,
others would have only the most learned, others again the richest,
and so on. All the princes of the neighbourhood put on their
bravest attire and presented themselves before her. Sometimes
they too had their own criers to enumerate their advantages and
the reasons why they hoped the princess would choose them. The
princess was taken round on a throne, in the most splendid array,
and looked at and heard about them. If she was not pleased with
what she saw and heard, she said to her bearers, "Move on," and
no more notice was taken of the rejected suitors. If, however, the
princess was pleased with any one of them, she threw a garland of
flowers over him and he became her husband.
The princess of the country to which our king and the Sannyasin
had come was having one of these interesting ceremonies. She
was the most beautiful princess in the world, and the husband of
the princess would be ruler of the kingdom after her father's death.
The idea of this princess was to marry the handsomest man, but
she could not find the right one to please her. Several times these
meetings had taken place, but the princess could not select a
husband. This meeting was the most splendid of all; more people

than ever had come it it. The princess came in on a throne, and the
bearers carried her from place to place. She did not seem to care
for any one, and every one became disappointed that this meeting
also was going to be a failure. Just then came a young man, a
Sannyasin, handsome as if the sun had come down to the earth,
and stood in one corner of the assembly, watching what was going
on. The throne with the princess came near him, and as soon as
she saw the beautiful Sannyasin, she stopped and threw the
garland over him. The young Sannyasin seized the garland and
threw it off, exclaiming, "What nonsense is this? I am a
Sannyasin. What is marriage to me?" The king of that country
thought that perhaps this man was poor and so dared not marry the
princess, and said to him, "With my daughter goes half my
kingdom now, and the whole kingdom after my death!" and put
the garland again on the Sannyasin. The young man threw it off
once more, saying, "Nonsense! I do not want to marry," and
walked quickly away from the assembly.
Now the princess had fallen so much in love with this young man
that she said, "I must marry this man or I shall die"; and she went
after him to bring him back. Then our other Sannyasin, who had
brought the king there, said to him, "King, let us follow this pair";
so they walked after them, but at a good distance behind. The
young Sannyasin who had refused to marry the princess walked
out into the country for several miles. When he came to a forest
and entered into it, the princess followed him, and the other two
followed them. Now this young Sannyasin was well acquainted
with that forest and knew all the intricate paths in it. He suddenly
passed into one of these and disappeared, and the princess could
not discover him. After trying for a long time to find him she sat
down under a tree and began to weep, for she did not know the
way out. Then our king and the other Sannyasin came up to her
and said, "Do not weep; we will show you the way out of this
forest, but it is too dark for us to find it now. Here is a big tree; let

us rest under it, and in the morning we will go early and show you
the road."
Now a little bird and his wife and their three little ones lived on
that tree, in a nest. This little bird looked down and saw the three
people under the tree and said to his wife, "My dear, what shall
we do? Here are some guests in the house, and it is winter, and we
have no fire." So he flew away and got a bit of burning firewood
in his beak and dropped it before the guests, to which they added
fuel and made a blazing fire. But the little bird was not satisfied.
He said again to his wife, "My dear, what shall we do? There is
nothing to give these people to eat, and they are hungry. We are
householders; it is our duty to feed any one who comes to the
house. I must do what I can, I will give them my body." So he
plunged into the midst of the fire and perished. The guests saw
him falling and tried to save him, but he was too quick for them.
The little bird's wife saw what her husband did, and she said,
"Here are three persons and only one little bird for them to eat. It
is not enough; it is my duty as a wife not to let my husband's
effort go in vain; let them have my body also." Then she fell into
the fire and was burned to death.
Then the three baby-birds, when they saw what was done and that
there was still not enough food for the three guests, said, "Our
parents have done what they could and still it is not enough. It is
our duty to carry on the work of our parents; let our bodies go
too." And they all dashed down into the fire also.
Amazed at what they saw, the three people could not of course eat
these birds. They passed the night without food, and in the
morning the king and the Sannyasin showed the princess the way,
and she went back to her father.
Then the Sannyasin said to the king, "King, you have seen that

each is great in his own place. If you want to live in the world,
live like those birds, ready at any moment to sacrifice yourself for
others. If you want to renounce the world, be like that young man
to whom the most beautiful woman and a kingdom were as
nothing. If you want to be a householder, hold your life a sacrifice
for the welfare of others; and if you choose the life of
renunciation, do not even look at beauty and money and power.
Each is great in his own place, but the duty of the one is not the
duty of the other."

CHAPTER 3
The Secret of Work
Helping others physically by removing their physical needs, is
indeed great, but the help is great according as the need is greater
and according as the help is far-reaching. If a man's wants can be
removed for an hour, it is helping him indeed; if his wants can be
removed for a year, it will be more help to him; but if his wants
can be removed for ever, it is surely the greatest help that can be
given him. Spiritual knowledge is the only thing that can destroy
our miseries for ever; any other knowledge satisfies wants only
for a time. It is only with the knowledge of the spirit that the
faculty of want is annihilated for ever; so helping man spiritually
is the highest help that can be given to him. He who gives man
spiritual knowledge is the greatest benefactor of mankind and as
such we always find that those were the most powerful of men
who helped man in his spiritual needs, because spirituality is the
file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (26 of 88)2/25/2007 9:26:35 PM

Karma Yoga

true basis of all our activities in life. A spiritually strong and
sound man will be strong in every other respect, if he so wishes.
Until there is spiritual strength in man even physical needs cannot
be well satisfied. Next to spiritual comes intellectual help. The gift
of knowledge is a far higher gift than that of food and clothes; it is
even higher than giving life to a man, because the real life of man
consists of knowledge. Ignorance is death, knowledge is life. Life
is of very little value, if it is a life in the dark, groping through
ignorance and misery. Next in order comes, of course, helping a
man physically. Therefore, in considering the question of helping
others, we must always strive not to commit the mistake of
thinking that physical help is the only help that can be given. It is
not only the last but the least, because it cannot bring about
permanent satisfaction. The misery that I feel when I am hungry is
satisfied by eating, but hunger returns; my misery can cease only
when I am satisfied beyond all want. Then hunger will not make
me miserable; no distress, no sorrow will be able to move me. So,
that help which tends to make us strong spiritually is the highest,
next to it comes intellectual help, and after that physical help.
The miseries of the world cannot be cured by physical help only.
Until man's nature changes, these physical needs will always
arise, and miseries will always be felt, and no amount of physical
help will cure them completely. The only solution of this problem
is to make mankind pure. Ignorance is the mother of all the evil
and all the misery we see. Let men have light, let them be pure
and spiritually strong and educated, then alone will misery cease
in the world, not before. We may convert every house in the
country into a charity asylum, we may fill the land with hospitals,
but the misery of man will still continue to exist until man's
character changes.
We read in the Bhagavad Gita again and again that we must all
work incessantly. All work is by nature composed of good and

Karma Yoga

evil. We cannot do any work which will not do some good
somewhere; there cannot be any work which will not cause some
harm somewhere. Every work must necessarily be a mixture of
good and evil; yet we are commanded to work incessantly. Good
and evil will both have their results, will produce their Karma.
Good action will entail upon us good effect; bad action, bad. But
good and bad are both bondages of the soul. The solution reached
in the Gita in regard to this bondage-producing nature of work is
that, if we do not attach ourselves to the work we do, it will not
have any binding effect on our soul. We shall try to understand
what is meant by this "non-attachment" to work.
This is the one central idea in the Gita: work incessantly, but be
not attached to it. Samskara can be translated very nearly by
"inherent tendency". Using the simile of a lake for the mind, every
ripple, every wave that rises in the mind, when it subsides, does
not die out entirely, but leaves a mark and a future possibility of
that wave coming out again. This mark, with the possibility of the
wave reappearing, is what is called Samskara. Every work that we
do, every movement of the body, every thought that we think,
leaves such an impression on the mind-stuff, and even when such
impressions are not obvious on the surface, they are sufficiently
strong to work beneath the surface, subconsciously. What we are
every moment is determined by the sum total of these impressions
on the mind. What I am just at this moment is the effect of the
sum total of all the impressions of my past life. This is really what
is meant by character; each man's character is determined by the
sum total of these impressions. If good impressions prevail, the
character becomes good; if bad, it becomes bad. If a man
continuously hears bad words, thinks bad thoughts, does bad
actions, his mind will be full of bad impressions; and they will
influence his thought and work without his being conscious of the
fact. In fact, these bad impressions are always working, and their
resultant must be evil, and that man will be a bad man; he cannot
file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (28 of 88)2/25/2007 9:26:35 PM

Karma Yoga

help it. The sum total of these impressions in him will create the
strong motive power for doing bad actions. He will be like a
machine in the hand of his impressions, and they will force him to
do evil. Similarly, if a man thinks good thoughts and does good
works, the sum total of these impressions will be good; and they,
in a similar manner, will force him to do good even in spite of
himself. When a man has done so much good work and thought so
many good thoughts that there is an irresistible tendency in him to
do good, in spite of himself and even if he wishes to do evil, his
mind, as the sum total of his tendencies, will not allow him to do
so; the tendencies will turn him back; he is completely under the
influence of the good tendencies. When such is the case, a man's
good character is said to be established.
As the tortoise tucks its feet and head inside the shell, and you
may kill it and break it in pieces, and yet it will not come out,
even so the character of that man who has control over his
motives and organs is unchangeably established. He controls his
own inner forces, and nothing can draw them out against his will.
By this continuous reflex of good thoughts, good impressions
moving over the surface of the mind, the tendency for doing good
becomes strong, and as the result we feel able to control the
Indriyas (the sense-organs, the nerve-centres). Thus alone will
character be established, then alone a man gets to truth. Such a
man is safe for ever; he cannot do any evil. You may place him in
any company, there will be no danger for him. There is a still
higher state than having this good tendency, and that is the desire
for liberation. You must remember that freedom of the soul is the
goal of all Yogas, and each one equally leads to the same result.
By work alone men may get to where Buddha got largely by
meditation or Christ by prayer. Buddha was a working Jnani,
Christ was a Bhakta, but the same goal was reached by both of
them. The difficulty is here. Liberation means entire freedom-freedom from the bondage of good, as well as from the bondage

of evil. A golden chain is as much a chain as an iron one. There is
a thorn in my finger, and I use another to take the first one out;
and when I have taken it out, I throw both of them aside; I have no
necessity for keeping the second thorn, because both are thorns
after all. So the bad tendencies are to be counteracted by the good
ones, and the bad impressions on the mind should be removed by
the fresh waves of good ones, until all that is evil almost
disappears, or is subdued and held in control in a corner of the
mind; but after that, the good tendencies have also to be
conquered. Thus the "attached" becomes the "unattached". Work,
but let not the action or the thought produce a deep impression on
the mind. Let the ripples come and go, let huge actions proceed
from the muscles and the brain, but let them not make any deep
impression on the soul.
How can this be done? We see that the impression of any action,
to which we attach ourselves, remains. I may meet hundred of
persons during the day, and among them meet also one whom I
love; and when I retire at night, I may try to think of all the faces I
saw, but only that face comes before the mind--the face which I
met perhaps only for one minute, and which I loved; all the others
have vanished. My attachment to this particular person caused a
deeper impression on my mind than all the other faces.
Physiologically the impressions have all been the same; every one
of the faces that I saw pictured itself on the retina, and the brain
took the pictures in, and yet there was no similarity of effect upon
the mind. Most of the faces, perhaps, were entirely new faces,
about which I had never thought before, but that one face of which
I got only a glimpse found associations inside. Perhaps I had
pictured him in my mind for years, knew hundreds of things about
him, and this one new vision of him awakened hundreds of
sleeping memories in my mind; and this one impression having
been repeated perhaps a hundred times more than those of the
different faces together, will produce a great effect on the mind.

Karma Yoga

Therefore, be "unattached"; let things work; let brain centres
work; work incessantly, but let not a ripple conquer the mind.
Work as if you were a stranger in this land, a sojourner; work
incessantly, but do not bind yourselves; bondage is terrible. This
world is not our habitation, it is only one of the many stages
through which we are passing. Remember that great saying of the
Sankhya, "The whole of nature is for the soul, not the soul for
nature." The very reason of nature's existence is for the education
of the soul; it has no other meaning; it is there because the soul
must have knowledge, and through knowledge free itself. If we
remember this always, we shall never be attached to nature; we
shall know that nature is a book in which we are to read, and that
when we have gained the required knowledge, the book is of no
more value to us. Instead of that, however, we are identifying
ourselves with nature; we are thinking that the soul is for nature,
that the spirit is for the flesh, and, as the common saying has it, we
think that man "lives to eat" and not "eats to live". We are
continually making this mistake; we are regarding nature as
ourselves and are becoming attached to it; and as soon as this
attachment comes, there is the deep impression on the soul, which
binds us down and makes us work not from freedom but like
slaves.
The whole gist of this teaching is that you should work like a
master and not as a slave; work incessantly, but do not do slave's
work. Do you not see how everybody works? Nobody can be
altogether at rest; ninety-nine per cent of mankind work like
slaves, and the result is misery; it is all selfish work. Work
through freedom! Work through love! The word "love" is very
difficult to understand; love never comes until there is freedom.
There is no true love possible in the slave. If you buy a slave and
tie him down in chains and make him work for you, he will work
like a drudge, but there will be no love in him. So when we
ourselves work for the things of the world as slaves, there can be

no love in us, and our work is not true work. This is true of work
done for relatives and friends, and is true of work done for our
own selves. Selfish work is slave's work; and here is a test. Every
act of love brings happiness; there is no act of love which does not
bring peace and blessedness as its reaction. Real existence, real
knowledge, and real love are eternally connected with one
another, the three in one: where one of them is, the others also
must be; they are the three aspects of the One without a second-the Existence-Knowledge-Bliss. When that existence becomes
relative, we see it as the world; that knowledge becomes in its turn
modified into the knowledge of the things of the world; and that
bliss forms the foundation of all true love known to the heart of
man. Therefore true love can never react so as to cause pain either
to the lover or to the beloved. Suppose a man loves a woman; he
wishes to have her all to himself and feels extremely jealous about
her every movement; he wants her to sit near him, to stand near
him, and to eat and move at his bidding. He is a slave to her and
wishes to have her as his slave. That is not love; it is a kind of
morbid affection of the slave, insinuating itself as love. It cannot
be love, because it is painful; if she does not do what he wants, it
brings him pain. With love there is no painful reaction; love only
brings a reaction of bliss; if it does not, it is not love; it is
mistaking something else for love. When you have succeeded in
loving your husband, your wife, your children, the whole world,
the universe, in such a manner that there is no reaction of pain or
jealousy, no selfish feeling, then you are in a fit state to be
unattached.
Krishna says, "Look at Me, Arjuna! If I stop from work for one
moment, the whole universe will die. I have nothing to gain from
work; I am the one Lord, but why do I work? Because I love the
world." God is unattached because He loves; that real love makes
us unattached. Wherever there is attachment, the clinging to the
things of the world, you must know that it is all physical attraction
file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (32 of 88)2/25/2007 9:26:35 PM

between sets of particles of matter--something that attracts two
bodies nearer and nearer all the time and, if they cannot get near
enough, produces pain; but where there is real love, it does not
rest on physical attachment at all. Such lovers may be a thousand
miles away from one another, but their love will be all the same; it
does not die, and will never produce any painful reaction.
To attain this unattachment is almost a life-work, but as soon as
we have reached this point, we have attained the goal of love and
become free; the bondage of nature falls from us, and we see
nature as she is; she forges no more chains for us; we stand
entirely free and take not the results of work into consideration;
who then cares for what the results may be?
Do you ask anything from your children in return for what you
have given them? It is your duty to work for them, and there the
matter ends. In whatever you do for a particular person, a city, or
a state, assume the same attitude towards it as you have towards
your children--expect nothing in return. If you can invariably take
the position of a giver, in which everything given by you is a free
offering to the world, without any thought of return, then will your
work bring you no attachment. Attachment comes only where we
expect a return.
If working like slaves results in selfishness and attachment,
working as master of our own mind gives rise to the bliss of nonattachment. We often talk of right and justice, but we find that in
the world right and justice are mere baby's talk. There are two
things which guide the conduct of men: might and mercy. The
exercise of might is invariably the exercise of selfishness. All men
and women try to make the most of whatever power or advantage
they have. Mercy is heaven itself; to be good, we have all to be
merciful. Even justice and right should stand on mercy. All
thought of obtaining return for the work we do hinders our

spiritual progress; nay, in the end it brings misery. There is
another way in which this idea of mercy and selfless charity can
be put into practice; that is, by looking upon work as "worship" in
case we believe in a Personal God. Here we give up all the fruits
of our work unto the Lord, and worshipping Him thus, we have no
right to expect anything from mankind for the work we do. The
Lord Himself works incessantly and is ever without attachment.
Just as water cannot wet the lotus leaf, so work cannot bind the
unselfish man by giving rise to attachment to results. The selfless
and unattached man may live in the very heart of a crowded and
sinful city; he will not be touched by sin.
This idea of complete self-sacrifice is illustrated in the following
story: After the battle of Kurukshetra the five Pandava brothers
performed a great sacrifice and made very large gifts to the poor.
All people expressed amazement at the greatness and richness of
the sacrifice, and said that such a sacrifice the world had never
seen before. But, after the ceremony, there came a little
mongoose, half of whose body was golden, and the other half
brown; and he began to roll on the floor of the sacrificial hall. He
said to those around, "You are all liars; this is no sacrifice."
"What!" they exclaimed, "you say this is no sacrifice; do you not
know how money and jewels were poured out to the poor and
every one became rich and happy? This was the most wonderful
sacrifice any man every performed." But the mongoose said,
"There was once a little village, and in it there dwelt a poor
Brahmin with his wife, his son, and his son's wife. They were very
poor and lived on small gifts made to them for preaching and
teaching. There came in that land a three years' famine, and the
poor Brahmin suffered more than ever. At last when the family
had starved for days, the father brought home one morning a little
barley flour, which he had been fortunate enough to obtain, and he
divided it into four parts, one for each member of the family. They
prepared it for their meal, and just as they were about to eat, there

was a knock at the door. The father opened it, and there stood a
guest. Now in India a guest is a sacred person; he is as a god for
the time being, and must be treated as such. So the poor Brahmin
said, "Come in, sir; you are welcome." He set before the guest his
own portion of the food, which the guest quickly ate and said,
"Oh, sir, you have killed me; I have been starving for ten days,
and this little bit has but increased my hunger." Then the wife said
to her husband, "Give him my share," but the husband said, "Not
so." The wife however insisted, saying, "Here is a poor man, and
it is our duty as householders to see that he is fed, and it is my
duty as a wife to give him my portion, seeing that you have no
more to offer him." Then she gave her share to the guest, which he
ate, and said he was still burning with hunger. So the son said,
"Take my portion also; it is the duty of a son to help his father to
fulfil his obligation." The guest ate that, but remained still
unsatisfied; so the son's wife gave him her portion also. That was
sufficient, and the guest departed, blessing them. That night those
four people died of starvation. A few granules of that flour had
fallen on the floor; and when I rolled my body on them, half of it
became golden, as you see. Since then I have been travelling all
over the world, hoping to find another sacrifice like that, but
nowhere have I found one; nowhere else has the other half of my
body been turned into gold. That is why I say this is no sacrifice."
This idea of charity is going out of India; great men are becoming
fewer and fewer. When I was first learning English, I read an
English story book in which there was a story about a dutiful boy
who had gone out to work and had given some of his money to his
old mother, and this was praised in three or four pages. What was
that? No Hindu boy can ever understand the moral of that story.
Now I understand it when I hear the Western idea--every man for
himself. And some men take everything for themselves, and
fathers and mothers and wives and children go to the wall. That
should never and nowhere be the ideal of the householder.

Now you see what Karma-Yoga means; even at the point of death
to help any one, without asking questions. Be cheated millions of
times and never ask a question, and never think of what you are
doing. Never vaunt of your gifts to the poor or expect their
gratitude, but rather be grateful to them for giving you the
occasion of practising charity to them. Thus it is plain that to be
an ideal householder is a much more difficult task than to be an
ideal Sannyasin; the true life of work is indeed as hard as, if not
harder than, the equally true life of renunciation.

CHAPTER 4
What is Duty
It is necessary in the study of Karma-Yoga to know what duty is.
If I have to do something I must first know that it is my duty, and
then I can do it. The idea of duty again is different in different
nations. The Mohammedan says what is written in his book, the
Koran, is his duty; the Hindu says what is in the Vedas is his duty;
and the Christian says what is in the Bible is his duty. We find that
there are varied ideas of duty, differing according to different
states in life, different historical periods and different nations. The
term "duty", like every other universal abstract term, is impossible
clearly to define; we can only get an idea of it by knowing its
practical operations and results. When certain things occur before
us, we have all a natural or trained impulse to act in a certain
manner towards them; when this impulse comes, the mind begins
file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (36 of 88)2/25/2007 9:26:35 PM

Karma Yoga

to think about the situation. Sometimes it thinks that it is good to
act in a particular manner under the given conditions; at other
times it thinks that it is wrong to act in the same manner even in
the very same circumstances. The ordinary idea of duty
everywhere is that every good man follows the dictates of his
conscience. But what is it that makes an act a duty? If a Christian
finds a piece of beef before him and does not eat it to save his own
life, or will not give it to save the life of another man, he is sure to
feel that he has not done his duty. But if a Hindu dares to eat that
piece of beef or to give it to another Hindu, he is equally sure to
feel that he too has not done his duty; the Hindu's training and
education make him feel that way. In the last century there were
notorious bands of robbers in India called thugs; they thought it
their duty to kill any man they could and take away his money; the
larger the number of men they killed, the better they thought they
were. Ordinarily if a man goes out into the street and shoots down
another man, he is apt to feel sorry for it, thinking that he has done
wrong. But if the very same man, as a soldier in his regiment, kills
not one but twenty, he is certain to feel glad and think that he has
done his duty remarkable well. Therefore we see that it is not the
thing done that defines a duty. To give an objective definition of
duty is thus entirely impossible. Yet there is duty from the
subjective side. Any action that makes us go Godward is a good
action, and is our duty; any action that makes us go downward is
evil, and is not our duty. From the subjective standpoint we may
see that certain acts have a tendency to exalt and ennoble us, while
certain other acts have a tendency to degrade and to brutalise us.
But it is not possible to make out with certainty which acts have
which kind of tendency in relation to all persons, of all sorts and
conditions. There is, however, only one idea of duty which has
been universally accepted by all mankind, of all ages and sects
and countries, and that has been summed up in a Sanskrit
aphorism thus: "Do not injure any being; not injuring any being is
virtue, injuring any being is sin."

Karma Yoga

The Bhagavad Gita frequently alludes to duties dependent upon
birth and position in life. Birth and position in life and in society
largely determine the mental and moral attitude of individuals
towards the various activities of life. It is therefore our duty to do
that work which will exalt and ennoble us in accordance with the
ideals and activities of the society in which we are born. But it
must be particularly remembered that the same ideals and
activities do not prevail in all societies and countries; our
ignorance of this is the main cause of much of the hatred of one
nation towards another. An American thinks that whatever an
American does in accordance with the custom of his country is the
best thing to do, and that whoever does not follow his custom
must be a very wicked man. A Hindu thinks that his customs are
the only right ones and are the best in the world, and that
whosoever does not obey them must be the most wicked man
living. This is quite a natural mistake which all of us are apt to
make. But it is very harmful; it is the cause of half the
uncharitableness found in the world. When I came to this country
and was going through the Chicago Fair, a man from behind
pulled at my turban. I looked back and saw that he was a very
gentlemanly-looking man, neatly dressed. I spoke to him; and
when he found that I knew English, he became very much
abashed. On another occasion in the same Fair another man gave
me a push. When I asked him the reason, he also was ashamed
and stammered out an apology saying, "Why do you dress that
way?" The sympathies of these men were limited within the range
of their own language and their own fashion of dress. Much of the
oppression of powerful nations on weaker ones is caused by this
prejudice. It dries up their fellow-feeling for fellow men. That
very man who asked me why I did not dress as he did and wanted
to ill-treat me because of my dress may have been a very good
man, a good father, and a good citizen; but the kindliness of his
nature died out as soon as he saw a man in a different dress.

Strangers are exploited in all countries, because they do not know
how to defend themselves; thus they carry home false impressions
of the peoples they have seen. Sailors, soldiers, and traders behave
in foreign lands in very queer ways, although they would not
dream of doing so in their own country; perhaps this is why the
Chinese call Europeans and Americans "foreign devils". They
could not have done this if they had met the good, the kindly sides
of Western life.
Therefore the one point we ought to remember is that we should
always try to see the duty of others through their own eyes, and
never judge the customs of other peoples by our own standard. I
am not the standard of the universe. I have to accommodate
myself to the world, and not the world to me. So we see that
environments change the nature of our duties, and doing the duty
which is ours at any particular time is the best thing we can do in
this world. Let us do that duty which is ours by birth; and when
we have done that, let us do the duty which is ours by our position
in life and in society. There is, however, one great danger in
human nature, viz. that man never examines himself. He thinks he
is quite as fit to be on the throne as the king. Even if he is, he must
first show that he has done the duty of his own position; and then
higher duties will come to him. When we begin to work earnestly
in the world, nature gives us blows right and left and soon enables
us to find out our position. No man can long occupy satisfactorily
a position for which he is not fit. There is no use in grumbling
against nature's adjustment. He who does the lower work is not
therefore a lower man. No man is to be judged by the mere nature
of his duties, but all should be judged by the manner and the spirit
in which they perform them.
Later on we shall find that even this idea of duty undergoes
change, and that the greatest work is done only when there is no
selfish motive to prompt it. Yet it is work through the sense of
file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (39 of 88)2/25/2007 9:26:35 PM

Karma Yoga

duty that leads us to work without any idea of duty; when work
will become worship--nay, something higher--then will work be
done for its own sake. We shall find that the philosophy of duty,
whether it be in the form of ethics or of love, is the same as in
every other Yoga--the object being the attenuating of the lower
self, so that the real higher Self may shine forth--the lessening of
the frittering away of energies on the lower plane of existence, so
that the soul may manifest itself on the higher ones. This is
accomplished by the continuous denial of low desires, which duty
rigorously requires. The whole organisation of society has thus
been developed, consciously or unconsciously, in the realms of
action and experience, where, by limiting selfishness, we open the
way to an unlimited expansion of the real nature of man.
Duty is seldom sweet. It is only when love greases its wheels that
it runs smoothly; it is a continuous friction otherwise. How else
could parents do their duties to their children, husbands to their
wives, and vice versa? Do we not meet with cases of friction
every day in our lives? Duty is sweet only through love, and love
shines in freedom alone. Yet is it freedom to be a slave to the
senses, to anger, to jealousies and a hundred other petty things that
must occur every day in human life? In all these little roughnesses
that we meet with in life, the highest expression of freedom is to
forbear. Women, slaves to their own irritable, jealous tempers, are
apt to blame their husbands, and assert their own "freedom", as
they think, not knowing that thereby they only prove that they are
slaves. So it is with husbands who eternally find fault with their
wives.
Chastity is the first virtue in man or woman, and the man who,
however he may have strayed away, cannot be brought to the right
path by a gentle and loving and chaste wife is indeed very rare.
The world is not yet as bad as that. We hear much about brutal
husbands all over the world and about the impurity of men, but is
file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (40 of 88)2/25/2007 9:26:35 PM

Karma Yoga

it not true that there are quite as many brutal and impure women
as men? If all women were as good and pure as their own constant
assertions would lead one to believe, I am perfectly satisfied that
there would not be one impure man in the world. What brutality is
there which purity and chastity cannot conquer? A good, chaste
wife, who thinks of every other man except her own husband as
her child and has the attitude of a mother towards all men, will
grow so great in the power of her purity that there cannot be a
single man, however brutal, who will not breathe an atmosphere
of holiness in her presence. Similarly, every husband must look
upon all women, except his own wife, in the light of his own
mother or daughter or sister. That man, again, who wants to be a
teacher of religion must look upon every woman as his mother,
and always behave towards her as such.
The position of the mother is the highest in the world, as it is the
one place in which to learn and exercise the greatest unselfishness.
The love of God is the only love that is higher than a mother's
love; all others are lower. It is the duty of the mother to think of
her children first and then of herself. But, instead of that, if the
parents are always thinking of themselves first, the result is that
the relation between parents and children becomes the same as
that between birds and their offspring which, as soon as they are
fledged, do not recognise any parents. Blessed, indeed, is the man
who is able to look upon woman as the representative of the
motherhood of God. Blessed, indeed, is the woman to whom man
represents the fatherhood of God. Blessed are the children who
look upon their parents as Divinity manifested on earth.
The only way to rise is by doing the duty next to us, and thus
gathering strength go on until we reach the highest state. A young
Sannyasin went to a forest; there he meditated, worshipped, and
practised Yoga for a long time. After years of hard work and
practice, he was one day sitting under a tree, when some dry
file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (41 of 88)2/25/2007 9:26:35 PM

leaves fell upon his head. He looked up and saw a crow and a
crane fighting on the top of the tree, which made him very angry.
He said, "What! Dare you throw these dry leaves upon my head!"
As with these words he angrily glanced at them, a flash of fire
went out of his head--such was the Yogi's power--and burnt the
birds to ashes. He was very glad, almost overjoyed at this
development of power--he could burn the crow and the crane by a
look. After a time he had to go to the town to beg his bread. He
went, stood at a door, and said, "Mother, give me food." A voice
came from inside the house, "Wait a little, my son." The young
man thought, "You wretched woman, how dare you make me
wait! You do not know my power yet." While he was thinking
thus the voice came again: "Boy, don't be thinking too much of
yourself. Here is neither crow nor crane." He was astonished; still
he had to wait. At last the woman came, and he fell at her feet and
said, "Mother, how did you know that?" She said, "My boy, I do
not know your Yoga or your practices. I am a common everyday
woman. I made you wait because my husband is ill, and I was
nursing him. All my life I have struggled to do my duty. When I
was unmarried, I did my duty to my parents; now that I am
married, I do my duty to my husband; that is all the Yoga I
practise. But by doing my duty I have become illumined; thus I
could read your thoughts and know what you had done in the
forest. If you want to know something higher than this, go to the
market of such and such a town where you will find a Vyadha
who will tell you something that you will be very glad to learn."
The Sannyasin thought, "Why should I go to that town and to a
Vyadha?" But after what he had seen, his mind opened a little, so
he went. When he came near the town, he found the market and
there saw, at a distance, a big fat Vyadha cutting meat with big
knives, talking and bargaining with different people. The young
man said, "Lord help me! Is this the man from whom I am going
to learn? He is the incarnation of a demon, if he is anything." In
the meantime this man looked up and said, "O Swami, did that

lady send you here? Take a seat until I have done my business."
The Sannyasin thought, "What comes to me here?" He took his
seat; the man went on with his work, and after he had finished he
took his money and said to the Sannyasin, "Come sir, come to my
home." On reaching home the Vyadha gave him a seat, saying,
"Wait here," and went into the house. He then washed his old
father and mother, fed them, and did all he could to please them,
after which he came to the Sannyasin and said, "Now, sir, you
have come here to see me; what can I do for you?" The Sannyasin
asked him a few questions about soul and about God, and the
Vyadha gave him a lecture which forms a part of the
Mahabharata, called the Vyadha Gita . It contains one of the
highest flights of the Vedanta. When the Vyadha finished his
teaching, the Sannyasin felt astonished. He said, "Why are you in
that body? With such knowledge as yours why are you in a
Vyadha's body, and doing such filthy, ugly work?" "My son,"
replied the Vyadha, "no duty is ugly, no duty is impure. My birth
placed me in these circumstances and environments. In my
boyhood I learnt the trade; I am unattached, and I try to do my
duty well. I try to do my duty as a householder, and I try to do all I
can to make my father and mother happy. I neither know your
Yoga, nor have I become a Sannyasin, nor did I go out of the
world into a forest; nevertheless, all that you have heard and seen
has come to me through the unattached doing of the duty which
belongs to my position."
There is a sage in India, a great Yogi, one of the most wonderful
men I have ever seen in my life. He is a peculiar man, he will not
teach any one; if you ask him a question he will not answer. It is
too much for him to take up the position of a teacher, he will not
do it. If you ask a question, and wait for some days, in the course
of conversation he will bring up the subject, and wonderful light
will he throw on it. He told me once the secret of work, "Let the
end and the means be joined into one." When you are doing any

work, do not think of anything beyond. Do it as worship, as the
highest worship, and devote your whole life to it for the time
being. Thus, in the story, the Vyadha and the woman did their
duty with cheerfulness and whole-heartedness; and the result was
that they become illuminated, clearly showing that the right
performance of the duties of any station in life, without
attachment to results, leads us to the highest realisation of the
perfection of the soul.
It is the worker who is attached to results that grumbles about the
nature of the duty which has fallen to his lot; to the unattached
worker all duties are equally good, and form efficient instruments
with which selfishness and sensuality may be killed, and the
freedom of the soul secured. We are all apt to think too highly of
ourselves. Our duties are determined by our deserts to a much
larger extent than we are willing to grant. Competition rouses
envy, and it kills the kindliness of the heart. To the grumbler all
duties are distasteful; nothing will ever satisfy him, and his whole
life is doomed to prove a failure. Let us work on, doing as we go
whatever happens to be our duty, and being ever ready to put our
shoulders to the wheel. Then surely shall we see the Light!

CHAPTER 5
We Help Ourselves, Not The
World

Karma Yoga

Before considering further how devotion to duty helps us in our
spiritual progress, let me place before you in a brief compass
another aspect of what we in India mean by Karma. In every
religion there are three parts: philosophy, mythology, and ritual.
Philosophy of course is the essence of every religion; mythology
explains and illustrates it by means of the more or less legendary
lives of great men, stories and fables of wonderful things, and so
on; ritual gives to that philosophy a still more concrete form, so
that every one may grasp it--ritual is in fact concretised
philosophy. This ritual is Karma; it is necessary in every religion,
because most of us cannot understand abstract spiritual things
until we grow much spiritually. It is easy for men to think that
they can understand anything; but when it comes to practical
experience, they find that abstract ideas are often very hard to
comprehend. Therefore symbols are of great help, and we cannot
dispense with the symbolical method of putting things before us.
From time immemmorial symbols have been used by all kinds of
religions. In one sense we cannot think but in symbols; words
themselves are symbols of thought. In another sense everything in
the universe may be looked upon as a symbol. The whole universe
is a symbol, and God is the essence behind. This kind of
symbology is not simply the creation of man; it is not that certain
people belonging to a religion sit down together and think out
certain symbols, and bring them into existence out of their own
minds. The symbols of religion have a natural growth. Otherwise,
why is it that certain symbols are associated with certain ideas in
the mind of almost every one? Certain symbols are universally
prevalent. Many of you may think that the cross first came into
existence as a symbol in connection with the Christian religion,
but as a matter of fact it existed before Christianity was, before

to have been in existence among the Aztecs and the Phoenicians;
every race seems to have had the cross. Again, the symbol of the
crucified Savior, of a man crucified upon a cross, appears to have
been known to almost every nation. The circle has been a great
symbol throughout the world. Then there is the most universal of
all symbols, the Swastika. At one time it was thought that the
Buddhists carried it all over the world with them, but it has been
found out that ages before Buddhism it was used among nations.
In Old Babylon and in Egypt it was to be found. What does this
show? All these symbols could not have been purely
conventional. There must be some reason for them; some natural
association between them and the human mind. Language is not
the result of convention; it is not that people ever agreed to
represent certain ideas by certain words; there never was an idea
without a corresponding word or a word without a corresponding
idea; ideas and words are in their nature inseparable. The symbols
to represent ideas may be sound symbols or colour symbols. Deaf
and dumb people have to think with other than sound symbols.
Every thought in the mind has a form as its counterpart. This is
called in Sanskrit philosophy Nama-Rupa--name and form. It is as
impossible to create by convention a system of symbols as it is to
create a language. In the world's ritualistic symbols we have an
expression of the religious thought of humanity. It is easy to say
that there is no use of rituals and temples and all such
paraphernalia; every baby says that in modern times. But it must
be easy for all to see that those who worship inside a temple are in
many respects different from those who will not worship there.
Therefore the association of particular temples, rituals, and other
concrete forms with particular religions has a tendency to bring
into the minds of the followers of those religions the thoughts for
which those concrete things stand as symbols; and it is not wise to
ignore rituals and symbology altogether. The study and practice of
these things form naturally a part of Karma-Yoga.

There are many other aspects of this science of work. One among
them is to know the relation between thought and word and what
can be achieved by the power of the word. In every religion the
power of the word is recognised, so much so that in some of them
creation itself is said to have come out of the word. The external
aspect of the thought of God is the Word, and as God thought and
willed before He created, creation came out of the Word. In this
stress and hurry of our materialistic life, our nerves lose
sensibility and become hardened. The older we grow, the longer
we are knocked about in the world, the more callous we become;
and we are apt to neglect things that even happen persistently and
prominently around us. Human nature, however, asserts itself
sometimes, and we are led to inquire into and wonder at some of
these common occurrences; wondering thus is the first step in the
acquisition of light. Apart from the higher philosophic and
religious value of the Word, we may see that sound symbols play
a prominent part in the drama of human life. I am talking to you. I
am not touching you; the pulsations of the air caused by my
speaking go into your ear, they touch your nerves and produce
effects in your minds. You cannot resist this. What can be more
wonderful than this? One man calls another a fool, and at this the
other stands up and clenches his fist and lands a blow on his nose.
Look at the power of the word! There is a woman weeping and
miserable; another woman comes along and speaks to her a few
gentle words, the doubled up frame of the weeping woman
becomes straightened at once, her sorrow is gone and she already
begins to smile. Think of the power of words! They are a great
force in higher philosophy as well as in common life. Day and
night we manipulate this force without thought and without
inquiry. To know the nature of this force and to use it well is also
a part of Karma-Yoga.
Our duty to others means helping others; doing good to the world.
Why should we do good to the world? Apparently to help the

world, but really to help ourselves. We should always try to help
the world, that should be the highest motive in us; but if we
consider well, we find that the world does not require our help at
all. This world was not made that you or I should come and help
it. I once read a sermon in which it was said, "All this beautiful
world is very good, because it gives us time and opportunity to
help others." Apparently, this is a very beautiful sentiment, but is
it not a blasphemy to say that the world needs our help? We
cannot deny that there is much misery in it; to go out and help
others is, therefore, the best thing we can do, although in the long
run, we shall find that helping others is only helping ourselves. As
a boy I had some white mice. They were kept in a little box in
which there were little wheels, and when the mice tried to cross
the wheels, the wheels turned and turned, and the mice never got
anywhere. So it is with the world and our helping it. The only help
is that we get moral exercise. This world is neither good nor evil;
each man manufactures a world for himself. If a blind man begins
to think of the world, it is either as soft or hard, or as cold or hot.
We are a mass of happiness or misery; we have seen that
hundreds of times in our lives. As a rule, the young are optimistic
and the old pessimistic. The young have life before them; the old
complain their day is gone; hundreds of desires, which they
cannot fulfil struggle in their hearts. Both are foolish nevertheless.
Life is good or evil according to the state of mind in which we
look at it, it is neither by itself. Fire, by itself, is neither good nor
evil. When it keeps us warm we say, "How beautiful is fire!"
When it burns our fingers, we blame it. Still, in itself it is neither
good nor bad. According as we use it, it produces in us the feeling
of good or bad; so also is this world. It is perfect. By perfection is
meant that it is perfectly fitted to meet its ends. We may all be
perfectly sure that it will go on beautifully well without us, and
we need not bother our heads wishing to help it.
Yet we must do good; the desire to do good is the highest motive

power we have, if we know all the time that it is a privilege to
help others. Do not stand on a high pedestal and take five cents in
your hand and say, "Here, my poor man," but be grateful that the
poor man is there, so that by making a gift to him you are able to
help yourself. It is not the receiver that is blessed, but it is the
giver. Be thankful that you are allowed to exercise your power of
benevolence and mercy in the world, and thus become pure and
perfect. All good acts tend to make us pure and perfect. What can
we do at best? Build a hospital, make roads, or erect charity
asylums. We may organise a charity and collect two or three
millions of dollars, build a hospital with one million, with the
second give balls and drink champagne, and of the third let the
officers steal half, and leave the rest finally to reach the poor; but
what are all these? One mighty wind in five minutes can break all
your buildings up. What shall we do then? One volcanic eruption
may sweep away all our roads and hospitals and cities and
buildings. Let us give up all this foolish talk of doing good to the
world. It is not waiting for your or my help; yet we must work and
constantly do good, because it is a blessing to ourselves. That is
the only way we can become perfect. No beggar whom we have
helped has ever owed a single cent to us; we owe everything to
him, because he has allowed us to exercise our charity on him. It
is entirely wrong to think that we have done, or can do, good to
the world, or to think that we have helped such and such people. It
is a foolish thought, and all foolish thoughts bring misery. We
think that we have helped some man and expect him to thank us,
and because he does not, unhappiness comes to us. Why should
we expect anything in return for what we do? Be grateful to the
man you help, think of him as God. Is it not a great privilege to be
allowed to worship God by helping our fellow men? If we were
really unattached, we should escape all this pain of vain
expectation, and could cheerfully do good work in the world.
Never will unhappiness or misery come through work done
without attachment. The world will go on with its happiness and

misery through eternity.
There was a poor man who wanted some money; and somehow he
had heard that if he could get hold of a ghost, he might command
him to bring money or anything else he liked; so he was very
anxious to get hold of a ghost. He went about searching for a man
who would give him a ghost, and at last he found a sage with
great powers, and besought his help. The sage asked him what he
would do with a ghost. "I want a ghost to work for me; teach me
how to get hold of one, sir; I desire it very much," replied the
man. But the sage said, "Don't disturb yourself, go home." The
next day the man went again to the sage and began to weep and
pray, "Give me a ghost; I must have a ghost, sir, to help me." At
last the sage was disgusted, and said, "Take this charm, repeat this
magic word, and a ghost will come, and whatever you say to him
he will do. But beware; they are terrible beings, and must be kept
continually busy. If you fail to give him work, he will take your
life." The man replied, "That is easy; I can give him work for all
his life." Then he went to a forest, and after long repetition of the
magic word, a huge ghost appeared before him, and said, "I am a
ghost. I have been conquered by your magic; but you must keep
me constantly employed. The moment you fail to give me work I
will kill you." The man said, "Build me a palace,", and the ghost
said, "It is done; the palace is built." "Bring me money," said the
man. "Here is your money," said the ghost. "Cut this forest down,
and build a city in its place." "That is done," said the ghost,
"anything more?" Now the man began to be frightened and
thought he could give him nothing more to do; he did everything
in a trice. The ghost said, "Give me something to do or I will eat
you up." The poor man could find no further occupation for him,
and was frightened. So he ran and ran and at last reached the sage,
and said, "Oh, sir, protect my life!" The sage asked him what the
matter was, and the man replied, "I have nothing to give the ghost
to do. Everything I tell him to do he does in a moment, and he

threatens to eat me up if I do not give him work." Just then the
ghost arrived, saying, "I'll eat you up," and he would have
swallowed the man. The man began to shake, and begged the sage
to save his life. The sage said, "I will find you a way out. Look at
that dog with a curly tail. Draw your sword quickly and cut the
tail off and give it to the ghost to straighten out." The man cut off
the dog's tail and gave it to the ghost, saying, "Straighten that out
for me." The ghost took it and slowly and carefully straightened it
out, but as soon as he let it go, it instantly curled up again. Once
more he laboriously straightened it out, only to find it again curled
up as soon as he attempted to let go of it. Again he patiently
straightened it out, but as soon as he let it go, it curled up again.
So he went on for days and days, until he was exhausted and said,
"I was never in such trouble before in my life. I am an old veteran
ghost, but never before was I in such trouble." "I will make a
compromise with you;" he said to the man, "you let me off and I
will let you keep all I have given you and will promise not to
harm you." The man was much pleased, and accepted the offer
gladly.
This world is like a dog's curly tail, and people have been striving
to straighten it out for hundreds of years; but when they let it go, it
has curled up again. How could it be otherwise? One must first
know how to work without attachment, then one will not be a
fanatic. When we know that this world is like a dog's curly tail
and will never get straightened, we shall not become fanatics. If
there were no fanaticism in the world, it would make much more
progress than it does now. It is a mistake to think that fanaticism
can make for the progress of mankind. On the contrary, it is a
retarding element creating hatred and anger, and causing people to
fight each other, and making them unsympathetic. We think that
whatever we do or possess is the best in the world, and what we
do not do or possess is of no value. So, always remember the
instance of the curly tail of the dog whenever you have a tendency

to become a fanatic. You need not worry or make yourself
sleepless about the world; it will go on without you. When you
have avoided fanaticism, then alone will you work well. It is the
level-headed man, the calm man, of good judgment and cool
nerves, of great sympathy and love, who does good work and so
does good to himself. The fanatic is foolish and has no sympathy;
he can never straighten the world, nor himself become pure and
perfect.
To recapitulate the chief points in today's lecture:
First, we have to bear in mind that we are all debtors to the world
and the world does not owe us anything. It is a great privilege for
all of us to be allowed to do anything for the world. In helping the
world we really help ourselves. The second point is that there is a
God in this universe. It is not true that this universe is drifting and
stands in need of help from you and me. God is ever present
therein, He is undying and eternally active and infinitely watchful.
When the whole universe sleeps, He sleeps not; He is working
incessantly; all the changes and manifestations of the world are
His. Thirdly, we ought not to hate anyone. This world will always
continue to be a mixture of good and evil. Our duty is to
sympathise with the weak and to love even the wrongdoer. The
world is a grand moral gymnasium wherein we have all to take
exercise so as to become stronger and stronger spiritually.
Fourthly, we ought not to be fanatics of any kind, because
fanaticism is opposed to love. You hear fanatics glibly saying, "I
do not hate the sinner. I hate the sin," but I am prepared to go any
distance to see the face of that man who can really make a
distinction between the sin and the sinner. It is easy to say so. If
we can distinguish well between quality and substance, we may
become perfect men. It is not easy to do this. And further, the
calmer we are and the less disturbed our nerves, the more shall we
love and the better will our work be.

CHAPTER 6
Non-attachment is the
complete self-abnegation
Just as every action that emanates from us comes back to us as
reaction, even so our actions may act on other people and theirs
on us. Perhaps all of you have observed it as a fact that when
persons do evil actions, they become more and more evil, and
when they begin to do good, they become stronger and stronger
and learn to do good at all times. This intensification of the
influence of action cannot be explained on any other ground than
that we can act and react upon each other. To take an illustration
from physical science, when I am doing a certain action, my mind
may be said to be in a certain state of vibration; all minds which
are in similar circumstances will have the tendency to be affected
by my mind. If there are different musical instruments tuned alike
in one room, all of you may have noticed that when one is struck,
the others have the tendency to vibrate so as to give the same
note. So all minds that have the same tension, so to say, will be
equally affected by the same thought. Of course, this influence of
thought on mind will vary according to distance and other causes,
but the mind is always open to affection. Suppose I am doing an
evil act, my mind is in a certain state of vibration, and all minds in
the universe, which are in a similar state, have the possibility of
being affected by the vibration of my mind. So, when I am doing
a good action, my mind is in another state of vibration; and all
file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (53 of 88)2/25/2007 9:26:35 PM

Karma Yoga

minds similarly strung have the possibility of being affected by
my mind; and this power of mind upon mind is more or less
according as the force of the tension is greater or less.
Following this simile further, it is quite possible that, just as light
waves may travel for millions of years before they reach any
object, so thought waves may also travel hundreds of years before
they meet an object with which they vibrate in unison. It is quite
possible, therefore, that this atmosphere of ours is full of such
thought pulsations, both good and evil. Every thought projected
from every brain goes on pulsating, as it were, until it meets a fit
object that will receive it. Any mind which is open to receive
some of these impulses will take them immediately. So, when a
man is doing evil actions, he has brought his mind to a certain
state of tension and all the waves which correspond to that state of
tension, and which may be said to be already in the atmosphere,
will struggle to enter into his mind. That is why an evil-doer
generally goes on doing more and more evil. His actions become
intensified. Such, also will be the case with the doer of good; he
will open himself to all the good waves that are in the atmosphere,
and his good actions also will become intensified. We run,
therefore, a twofold danger in doing evil: first, we open ourselves
to all the evil influences surrounding us; secondly, we create evil
which affects others, may be hundreds of years hence. In doing
evil we injure ourselves and others also. In doing good we do
good to ourselves and to others as well; and, like all other forces
in man, these forces of good and evil also gather strength from
outside.
According to Karma-Yoga, the action one has done cannot be
destroyed until it has borne its fruit; no power in nature can stop it
from yielding its results. If I do an evil action, I must suffer for it;
there is no power in this universe to stop or stay it. Similarly, if I
do a good action, there is no power in the universe which can stop
file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (54 of 88)2/25/2007 9:26:35 PM

Karma Yoga

its bearing good results. The cause must have its effect; nothing
can prevent or restrain this. Now comes a very fine and serious
question about Karma-Yoga--namely, that these actions of ours,
both good and evil, are intimately connected with each other. We
cannot put a line of demarcation and say, this action is entirely
good and this entirely evil. There is no action which does not bear
good and evil fruits at the same time. To take the nearest example:
I am talking to you, and some of you, perhaps, think I am doing
good; and at the same time I am, perhaps, killing thousands of
microbes in the atmosphere; I am thus doing evil to something
else. When it is very near to us and affects those we know, we say
that it is very good action if it affects them in a good manner. For
instance, you may call my speaking to you very good, but the
microbes will not; the microbes you do not see, but yourselves
you do see. The way in which my talk affects you is obvious to
you, but how it affects the microbes is not so obvious. And so, if
we analyse our evil actions also, we may find that some good
possibly results from them somewhere. He who in good action
sees that there is something evil in it, and in the midst of evil sees
that there is something good in it somewhere, has known the
secret of work.
But what follows from it? That, howsoever we may try, there
cannot be any action which is perfectly pure, or any which is
perfectly impure, taking purity and impurity in the sense of injury
and non-injury. We cannot breathe or live without injuring others,
and every bit of the food we eat is taken away from another's
mouth. Our very lives are crowding out other lives. It may be
men, or animals, or small microbes, but some one or other of
these we have to crowd out. That being the case, it naturally
follows that perfection can never be attained by work. We may
work through all eternity, but there will be no way out of this
intricate maze. You may work on, and on, and on; there will be no
end to this inevitable association of good and evil in the results of
file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (55 of 88)2/25/2007 9:26:35 PM

work.
The second point to consider is, what is the end of work? We find
the vast majority of people in every country believing that there
will be a time when this world will become perfect, when there
will be no disease, nor death, nor unhappiness, nor wickedness.
That is a very good idea, a very good motive power to inspire and
uplift the ignorant; but if we think for a moment, we shall find on
the very face of it that it cannot be so. How can it be, seeing that
good and evil are the obverse and reverse of the same coin? How
can you have good without evil at the same time? What is meant
by perfection? A perfect life is a contradiction in terms. Life itself
is a state of continuous struggle between ourselves and everything
outside. Every moment we are fighting actually with external
nature, and if we are defeated, our life has to go. It is, for instance,
a continuous struggle for food and air. If food or air fails, we die.
Life is not a simple and smoothly flowing thing, but it is a
compound effect. This complex struggle between something
inside and the external world is what we call life. So it is clear that
when this struggle ceases, there will be an end of life.
What is meant by ideal happiness is the cessation of this struggle.
But then life will cease, for the struggle can only cease when life
itself has ceased. We have seen already that in helping the world
we help ourselves. The main effect of work done for others is to
purify ourselves. By means of the constant effort to do good to
others we are trying to forget ourselves; this forgetfulness of self
is the one great lesson we have to learn in life. Man thinks
foolishly that he can make himself happy, and after years of
struggle finds out at last that true happiness consists in killing
selfishness and that no one can make him happy except himself.
Every act of charity, every thought of sympathy, every action of
help, every good deed, is taking so much of self-importance away
from our little selves and making us think of ourselves as the
file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (56 of 88)2/25/2007 9:26:35 PM

Karma Yoga

lowest and the least, and, therefore, it is all good. Here we find
that Jnana, Bhakti, and Karma--all come to one point. The highest
ideal is eternal and entire self-abnegation, where there is no "I",
but all is "Thou"; and whether he is conscious or unconscious of
it, Karma-Yoga leads man to that end. A religious preacher may
become horrified at the idea of an Impersonal God; he may insist
on a Personal God and wish to keep up his own identity and
individuality, whatever he may mean by that. But his ideas of
ethics, if they are really good, cannot but be based on the highest
self-abnegation. It is the basis of all morality; you may extend it to
men, or animals, or angels, it is the one basic idea, the one
fundamental principle running through all ethical systems.
You will find various classes of men in this world. First, there are
the God-men, whose self-abnegation is complete, and who do
only good to others even at the sacrifice of their own lives. These
are the highest of men. If there are a hundred of such in any
country, that country need never despair. But they are
unfortunately too few. Then there are the good men who do good
to others so long as it does not injure themselves. And there is a
third class who, to do good to themselves, injure others. It is said
by a Sanskrit poet that there is a fourth unnamable class of people
who injure others merely for injury's sake. Just as there are at one
pole of existence the highest good men, who do good for the sake
of doing good, so, at the other pole, there are others who injure
others just for the sake of the injury. They do not gain anything
thereby, but it is their nature to do evil.
Here are two Sanskrit words. The one is Pravritti, which means
revolving towards, and the other is Nivritti, which means
revolving away. The "revolving towards" is what we call the
world, the "I and mine"; it includes all those things which are
always enriching that "me" by wealth and money and power, and
name and fame, and which are of a grasping nature, always
file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (57 of 88)2/25/2007 9:26:35 PM

Karma Yoga

tending to accumulate everything in one centre, that centre being
"myself". That is the Pravritti, the natural tendency of every
human being; taking everything from everywhere and heaping it
around one centre, that centre being man's own sweet self. When
this tendency begins to break, when it is Nivritti or "going away
from," then begin morality and religion. Both Pravritti and Nivritti
are of the nature of work: the former is evil work, and the latter is
good work. This Nivritti is the fundamental basis of all morality
and all religion, and the very perfection of it is entire selfabnegation, readiness to sacrifice mind and body and everything
for another being. When a man has reached that state, he has
attained to the perfection of Karma-Yoga. This is the highest
result of good works. Although a man has not studied a single
system of philosophy, although he does not believe in any God,
and never has believed, although he has not prayed even once in
his whole life, if the simple power of good actions has brought
him to that state where he is ready to give up his life and all else
for others, he has arrived at the same point to which the religious
man will come through his prayers and the philosopher through
his knowledge; and so you may find that the philosopher, the
worker, and the devotee, all meet at one point, that one point
being self-abnegation. However much their systems of philosophy
and religion may differ, all mankind stand in reverence and awe
before the man who is ready to sacrifice himself for others. Here,
it is not at all any question of creed, or doctrine- even men who
are very much opposed to all religious ideas, when they see one of
these acts of complete self-sacrifice, feel that they must revere it.
Have you not seen even a most bigoted Christian, when he reads
Edwin Arnold's Light of Asia, stand in reverence of Buddha, who
preached no God, preached nothing but self-sacrifice? The only
thing is that the bigot does not know that his own end and aim in
life is exactly the same as that of those from whom he differs. The
worshipper, by keeping constantly before him the idea of God and
a surrounding of good, comes to the same point at last and says,
file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (58 of 88)2/25/2007 9:26:35 PM

Karma Yoga

"Thy will be done," and keeps nothing to himself. That is selfabnegation. The philosopher, with his knowledge, sees that the
seeming self is a delusion and easily gives it up. It is selfabnegation. So Karma, Bhakti, and Jnana all meet here; and this is
what was meant by all the great preachers of ancient times, when
they taught that God is not the world. There is one thing which is
the world and another which is God; and this distinction is very
true. What they mean by world is selfishness. Unselfishness is
God. One may live on a throne, in a golden palace, and be
perfectly unselfish; and then he is in God. Another may live in a
hut and wear rags, and have nothing in the world; yet, if he is
selfish, he is intensely merged in the world.
To come back to one of our main points, we say that we cannot do
good without at the same time doing some evil, or do evil without
doing some good. Knowing this, how can we work? There have,
therefore, been sects in this world who have in an astoundingly
preposterous way preached slow suicide as the only means to get
out of the world, because if a man lives, he has to kill poor little
animals and plants or do injury to something or some one. So
according to them the only way out of the world is to die. The
Jains have preached this doctrine as their highest ideal. This
teaching seems to be very logical. But the true solution is found in
the Gita. It is the theory of non-attachment, to be attached to
nothing while doing our work of life. Know that you are separated
entirely from the world, though you are in the world, and that
whatever you may be doing in it, you are not doing that for your
own sake. Any action that you do for yourself will bring its effect
to bear upon you. If it is a good action, you will have to take the
good effect, and if bad, you will have to take the bad effect; but
any action that is not done for your own sake, whatever it be, will
have no effect on you. There is to be found a very expressive
sentence in our scriptures embodying this idea: "Even if he kill
the whole universe (or be himself killed), he is neither the killer

nor the killed, when he knows that he is not acting for himself at
all." Therefore Karma-Yoga teaches, "Do not give up the world;
live in the world, imbibe its influences as much as you can; but if
it be for your own enjoyment's sake, work not at all." Enjoyment
should not be the goal. First kill your self and then take the whole
world as yourself; as the old Christians used to say, "The old man
must die." This old man is the selfish idea that the whole world is
made for our enjoyment. Foolish parents teach their children to
pray, "O Lord, Thou hast created this sun for me and this moon
for me," as if the Lord has had nothing else to do than to create
everything for these babies. Do not teach your children such
nonsense. Then again, there are people who are foolish in another
way: they teach us that all these animals were created for us to kill
and eat, and that this universe is for the enjoyment of men. That is
all foolishness. A tiger may say, "Man was created for me," and
pray, "O Lord, how wicked are these men who do not come and
place themselves before me to be eaten; they are breaking Your
law." If the world is created for us, we are also created for the
world. That this world is created for our enjoyment is the most
wicked idea that holds us down. This world is not for our sake.
Millions pass out of it every year; the world does not feel it;
millions of others are supplied in their place. Just as much as the
world is for us, so we also are for the world. To work properly,
therefore, you have first to give up the idea of attachment.
Secondly, do not mix in the fray, hold yourself as a witness and
go on working. My master used to say, "Look upon your children
as a nurse does." The nurse will take your baby and fondle it and
play with it and behave towards it as gently as if it were her own
child; but as soon as you give her notice to quit, she is ready to
start off bag and baggage from the house. Everything in the shape
of attachment is forgotten; it will not give the ordinary nurse the
least pang to leave your children and take up other children. Even
so are you to be with all that you consider your own. You are the
nurse, and if you believe in God, believe that all these things

which you consider yours are really His. The greatest weakness
often insinuates itself as the greatest good and strength. It is a
weakness to think that any one is dependent on me, and that I can
do good to another. This belief is the mother of all our attachment,
and through this attachment comes all our pain. We must inform
our minds that no one in this universe depends upon us; not one
beggar depends on our charity; not one soul on our kindness; not
one living thing on our help. All are helped on by nature, and will
be so helped even though millions of us were not here. The course
of nature will not stop for such as you and me; it is, as already
pointed out, only a blessed privilege to you and to me that we are
allowed, in the way of helping others, to educate ourselves. This
is a great lesson to learn in life, and when we have learned it fully,
we shall never be unhappy; we can go and mix without harm in
society anywhere and everywhere. You may have wives and
husbands, and regiments of servants, and kingdoms to govern; if
only you act on the principle that the world is not for you and
does not inevitably need you, they can do you no harm. This very
year some of your friends may have died. Is the world waiting
without going on, for them to come again? Is its current stopped?
No, it goes on. So drive out of your mind the idea that you have to
do something for the world; the world does not require any help
from you. It is sheer nonsense on the part of any man to think that
he is born to help the world; it is simply pride, it is selfishness
insinuating itself in the form of virtue. When you have trained
your mind and your nerves to realise this idea of the world's nondependence on you or on anybody, there will then be no reaction
in the form of pain resulting from work. When you give
something to a man and expect nothing--do not even expect the
man to be grateful--his ingratitude will not tell upon you, because
you never expected anything, never thought you had any right to
anything in the way of a return. You gave him what he deserved;
his own Karma got it for him; your Karma made you the carrier
thereof. Why should you be proud of having given away

something? You are the porter that carried the money or other
kind of gift, and the world deserved it by its own Karma. Where is
then the reason for pride in you? There is nothing very great in
what you give to the world. When you have acquired the feeling
of non-attachment, there will then be neither good nor evil for
you. It is only selfishness that causes the difference between good
and evil. It is a very hard thing to understand, but you will come
to learn in time that nothing in the universe has power over you
until you allow it to exercise such a power. Nothing has power
over the Self of man, until the Self becomes a fool and loses
independence. So, by non-attachment, you overcome and deny the
power of anything to act upon you. It is very easy to say that
nothing has the right to act upon you until you allow it to do so;
but what is the true sign of the man who really does not allow
anything to work upon him, who is neither happy nor unhappy
when acted upon by the external world? The sign is that good or
ill fortune causes no change in his mind: in all conditions he
continues to remain the same.
There was a great sage in India called Vyasa. This Vyasa is
known as the author of the Vedanta aphorisms, and was a holy
man. His father had tried to become a very perfect man and had
failed. His grandfather had also tried and failed. His greatgrandfather had similarly tried and failed. He himself did not
succeed perfectly, but his son, Shuka, was born perfect. Vyasa
taught his son wisdom; and after teaching him the knowledge of
truth himself, he sent him to the court of King Janaka. He was a
great king and was called Janaka Videha. Videha means "without
a body". Although a king, he had entirely forgotten that he was a
body; he felt that he was a spirit all the time. This boy Shuka was
sent to be taught by him. The king knew that Vyasa's son was
coming to him to learn wisdom: so he made certain arrangements
beforehand. And when the boy presented himself at the gates of
the palace, the guards took no notice of him whatsoever. They

only gave him a seat, and he sat there for three days and nights,
nobody speaking to him, nobody asking him who he was or
whence he was. He was the son of a very great sage, his father
was honoured by the whole country, and he himself was a most
respectable person; yet the low, vulgar guards of the palace would
take no notice of him. After that, suddenly, the ministers of the
king and all the big officials came there and received him with the
greatest honours. They conducted him in and showed him into
splendid rooms, gave him the most fragrant baths and wonderful
dresses, and for eight days they kept him there in all kinds of
luxury. That solemnly serene face of Shuka did not change even
to the smallest extent by the change in the treatment accorded to
him; he was the same in the midst of this luxury as when waiting
at the door. Then he was brought before the king. The king was on
his throne, music was playing, and dancing and other amusements
were going on. The king then gave him a cup of milk, full to the
brim, and asked him to go seven times round the hall without
spilling even a drop. The boy took the cup and proceeded in the
midst of the music and the attraction of the beautiful faces. As
desired by the king, seven times did he go round, and not a drop
of the milk was spilt. The boy's mind could not be attracted by
anything in the world, unless he allowed it to affect him. And
when he brought the cup to the king, the king said to him, "What
your father has taught you, and what you have learned yourself, I
can only repeat. You have known the Truth; go home."
Thus the man that has practised control over himself cannot be
acted upon by anything outside; there is no more slavery for him.
His mind has become free. Such a man alone is fit to live well in
the world. We generally find men holding two opinions regarding
the world. Some are pessimists and say, "How horrible this world
is, how wicked!" Some others are optimists and say, "How
beautiful this world is, how wonderful!" To those who have not
controlled their own minds, the world is either full of evil or at

best a mixture of good and evil. This very world will become to
us an optimistic world when we become masters of our own
minds. Nothing will then work upon us as good or evil; we shall
find everything to be in its proper place, to be harmonious. Some
men, who begin by saying that the world is a hell, often end by
saying that it is a heaven when they succeed in the practice of selfcontrol. If we are genuine Karma Yogis and wish to train
ourselves to that attainment of this state, wherever we may begin
we are sure to end in perfect self-abnegation; and as soon as this
seeming self has gone, the whole world, which at first appears to
us to be filled with evil, will appear to be heaven itself and full of
blessedness. Its very atmosphere will be blessed; every human
face there will be god. Such is the end and aim of Karma-Yoga,
and such is its perfection in practical life. Our various Yogas do
not conflict with each other; each of them leads us to the same
goal and makes us perfect. Only each has to be strenuously
practised. The whole secret is in practising. First you have to hear,
then think, and then practise. This is true of every Yoga. You have
first to hear about it and understand what it is; and many things
which you do not understand will be made clear to you by
constant hearing and thinking. It is hard to understand everything
at once. The explanation of everything is after all in yourself. No
one was ever really taught by another; each of us has to teach
himself. The external teacher offers only the suggestion which
rouses the internal teacher to work to understand things. Then
things will be made clearer to us by our own power of perception
and thought, and we shall realise them in our own souls; and that
realisation will grow into the intense power of will. First it is
feeling, then it becomes willing, and out of that willing comes the
tremendous force for work that will go through every vein and
nerve and muscle, until the whole mass of your body is changed
into an instrument of the unselfish Yoga of work, and the desired
result of perfect self-abnegation and utter unselfishness is duly
attained. This attainment does not depend on any dogma, or

doctrine, or belief. Whether one is Christian, or Jew, or Gentile, it
does not matter. Are you unselfish? That is the question. If you
are, you will be perfect without reading a single religious book,
without going into a single church or temple. Each one of our
Yogas is fitted to make man perfect even without the help of the
others, because they have all the same goal in view. The Yogas of
work, of wisdom, and of devotion are all capable of serving as
direct and independent means for the attainment of Moksha.
"Fools alone say that work and philosophy are different, not the
learned." The learned know that, though apparently different from
each other, they at last lead to the same goal of human perfection.

CHAPTER 7
Freedom
In addition to meaning work, we have stated that psychologically
the word Karma also implies causation. Any work, any action, any
thought that produces an effect is called a Karma. Thus the law of
Karma means the law of causation, of inevitable cause and
sequence. Wheresoever there is a cause, there an effect must be
produced; this necessity cannot be resisted, and this law of Karma,
according to our philosophy, is true throughout the whole
universe. Whatever we see, or feel, or do, whatever action there is
anywhere in the universe, while being the effect of past work on
the one hand, becomes, on the other, a cause in its turn, and
produces its own effect. It is necessary, together with this, to
consider what is meant by the word "law". By law is meant the
file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (65 of 88)2/25/2007 9:26:35 PM

Karma Yoga

tendency of a series to repeat itself. When we see one event
followed by another, or sometimes happening simultaneously with
another, we expect this sequence or co-existence to recur. Our old
logicians and philosophers of the Nyaya school call this law by the
name of Vyapti. According to them, all our ideas of law are due to
association. A series of phenomena becomes associated with
things in our mind in a sort of invariable order, so that whatever
we perceive at any time is immediately referred to other facts in
the mind. Any one idea or, according to our psychology, any one
wave that is produced in the mind-stuff, Chitta, must always give
rise to many similar waves. This is the psychological idea of
association, and causation is only as aspect of this grand pervasive
principle of association. This pervasiveness of association is what
is, in Sanskrit, called Vyapti. In the external world the idea of law
is the same as in the internal--the expectation that a particular
phenomenon will be followed by another, and that the series will
repeat itself. Really speaking, therefore, law does not exist in
nature. Practically it is an error to say that gravitation exists in the
earth, or that there is any law existing objectively anywhere in
nature. Law is the method, the manner in which our mind grasps a
series of phenomena; it is all in the mind. Certain phenomena,
happening one after another or together, and followed by the
conviction of the regularity of their recurrence--thus enabling our
minds to grasp the method of the whole series--constitute what we
call law.
The next question for consideration is what we mean by law being
universal. Our universe is that portion of existence which is
characterised by what the Sanskrit psychologists call Desha-kalanimitta, or what is known to European psychology as space, time,
and causation. This universe is only a part of infinite existence,
thrown into a peculiar mould, composed of space, time, and
causation. It necessarily follows that law is possible only within
this conditioned universe; beyond it there cannot be any law.
file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (66 of 88)2/25/2007 9:26:35 PM

Karma Yoga

When we speak of the universe, we only mean that portion of
existence which is limited by our mind--the universe of the senses,
which we can see, feel, touch, hear, think of, imagine. This alone
is under law; but beyond it existence cannot be subject to law,
because causation does not extend beyond the world of our minds.
Anything beyond the range of our mind and our senses is not
bound by the law of causation, as there is no mental association of
things in the region beyond the senses, and no causation without
association of ideas. It is only when "being" or existence gets
moulded into name and form that it obeys the law of causation,
and is said to be under law; because all law has its essence in
causation. Therefore we see at once that there cannot be any such
thing as free will; the very words are a contradiction, because will
is what we know and everything that we know is within our
universe, and everything within our universe is mouled by the
conditions of space, time, and causation. Everything that we
know, or can possibly know, must be subject to causation, and that
which obeys the law of causation cannot be free. It is acted upon
by other agents, and becomes a cause in its turn. But that which
has become converted into the will, which was not the will before,
but which, when it fell into this mould of space, time, and
causation, became converted into the human will, is free; and
when this will gets out of this mould of space,time, and causation,
it will be free again. From freedom it comes, and becomes
moulded into this bondage, and it gets out and goes back to
freedom again.
The question has been raised as to from whom this universe
comes, in whom it rests, and to whom it goes; and the answer has
been given that from freedom it comes, in bondage it rests, and
goes back into that freedom again. So, when we speak of man as
no other than that infinite being which is manifesting itself, we
mean that only one very small part thereof is man; this body and
this mind which we see are only one part of the whole, only one
file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (67 of 88)2/25/2007 9:26:35 PM

Karma Yoga

spot of the infinite being. This whole universe is only one speck of
the infinite being; and all our laws, our bondages, our joys and our
sorrows, our happinesses and our expectations, are only within
this small universe; all our progression and digression are within
its small compass. So you see how childish it is to expect a
continuation of this universe--the creation of our minds--and to
expect to go to heaven, which after all must mean only a repetition
of this world that we know. You see at once that it is an
impossible and childish desire to make the whole of infinite
existence conform to the limited and conditioned existence which
we know. When a man says that he will have again and again this
same thing which he is having now, or, as I sometimes put it,
when he asks for a comfortable religion, you may know that he
has become so degenerate that he cannot think of anything higher
than what he is now; he is just his little present surroundings and
nothing more. He has forgotten his infinite nature, and his whole
idea is confined to these little joys, and sorrows, and heartjealousies of the moment. He thinks that this finite thing is the
infinite; and not only so, he will not let this foolishness go. He
clings on desperately unto Trishna, and the thirst after life, what
the Buddhists call Tanha and Tissa. There may be millions of
kinds of happiness, and beings, and laws, and progress, and
causation, all acting outside the little universe that we know; and,
after all, the whole of this comprises but one section of our infinite
nature.
To acquire freedom we have to get beyond the limitations of this
universe; it cannot be found here. Perfect equilibrium, or what the
Christians call the peace that passeth all understanding, cannot be
had in this universe, nor in heaven, nor in any place where our
mind and thoughts can go, where the senses can feel, or which the
imagination can conceive. No such place can give us that freedom,
because all such places would be within our universe, and it is
limited by space, time, and causation. There may be places that
file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (68 of 88)2/25/2007 9:26:35 PM

Karma Yoga

are more ethereal than this earth of ours, where enjoyments may
be keener, but even those places must be in the universe and,
therefore, in bondage to law; so we have to go beyond, and real
religion begins where this little universe ends. These little joys,
and sorrows, and knowledge of things end there, and the reality
begins. Until we give up the thirst after life, the strong attachment
to this our transient conditioned existence, we have no hope of
catching even a glimpse of that infinite freedom beyond. It stands
to reason then that there is only one way to attain to that freedom
which is the goal of all the noblest aspirations of mankind, and
that is by giving up this little life, giving up this little universe,
giving up this earth, giving up heaven, giving up the body, giving
up the mind, giving up everything that is limited and conditioned.
If we give up our attachment to this little universe of the senses or
of the mind, we shall be free immediately. The only way to come
out of bondage is to go beyond the limitations of law, to go
beyond causation.
But it is a most difficult thing to give up the clinging to this
universe; few ever attain to that. There are two ways to do that
mentioned in our books. One is called the "Neti, Neti" (not this,
not this), the other is called "iti" (this); the former is the negative,
and the latter is the positive way. The negative way is the most
difficult. It is only possible to the men of the very highest,
exceptional minds and gigantic wills who simply stand up and say,
"No, I will not have this," and the mind and body obey their will,
and they come out successful. But such people are very rare. The
vast majority of mankind choose the positive way, the way
through the world, making use of all the bondages themselves to
break those very bondages. This is also a kind of giving up; only it
is done slowly and gradually, by knowing things, enjoying things
and thus obtaining experience, and knowing the nature of things
until the mind lets them all go at last and becomes unattached. The
former way of obtaining non-attachment is by reasoning, and the
file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (69 of 88)2/25/2007 9:26:35 PM

Karma Yoga

latter way is through work and experience. The first is the path of
Jnana-Yoga and is characterised by the refusal to do any work; the
second is that of Karma-Yoga, in which there is no cessation from
work. Every one must work in the universe. Only those who are
perfectly satisfied with the Self, whose desires do not go beyond
the Self, whose mind never strays out of the Self, to whom the
Self is all in all, only those do not work. The rest must work. A
current rushing down of its own nature falls into a hollow and
makes a whirlpool, and, after running a little in that whirlpool, it
emerges again in the form of the free current to go on unchecked.
Each human life is like that current. It gets into the whirl, gets
involved in this world of space, time, and causation, whirls round
a little, crying out, "my father, my brother, my name, my fame,"
and so on, and at last emerges out of it and regains its original
freedom. The whole universe is doing that. Whether we know it or
not, whether we are conscious or unconscious of it, we are all
working to get out of the dream of the world. Man's experience in
the world is to enable him to get out of its whirlpool.
What is Karma-Yoga? The knowledge of the secret of work. We
see that the whole universe is working. For what? For salvation,
for liberty; from the atom to the highest being, working for the one
end, liberty for the mind, for the body, for the spirit. All things are
always trying to get freedom, flying away from bondage. The sun,
the moon, the earth, the planets, all are trying to fly away from
bondage. The centrifugal and the centripetal forces of nature are
indeed typical of our universe. Instead of being knocked about in
this universe, and after long delay and thrashing, getting to know
things as they are, we learn from Karma-Yoga the secret of work,
the method of work, the organising power of work. A vast mass of
energy may be spent in vain if we do not know how to utilise it.
Karma- Yoga makes a science of work; you learn by it how best to
utilise all the workings of this world. Work is inevitable, it must
be so; but we should work to the highest purpose. Karma-Yoga

Karma Yoga

makes us admit that this world is a world of five minutes, that it is
a something we have to pass through; and that freedom is not here,
but is only to be found beyond. To find the way out of the
bondages of the world we have to go through it slowly and surely.
There may be those exceptional persons about whom I just spoke,
those who can stand aside and give up the world, as a snake casts
off its skin and stands aside and looks at it. There are no doubt
these exceptional beings; but the rest of mankind have to go
slowing through the world of work. Karma-Yoga shows the
process, the secret, and the method of doing it to the best
advantage.
What does it say? "Work incessantly, but give up all attachment to
work." Do not identify yourself with anything. Hold your mind
free. All this that you see, the pains and the miseries, are but the
necessary conditions of this world; poverty and wealth and
happiness are but momentary; they do not belong to our real
nature at all. Our nature is far beyond misery and happiness,
beyond every object of the senses, beyond the imagination; and
yet we must go on working all the time. "Misery comes through
attachment, not through work." As soon as we identify ourselves
with the work we do, we feel miserable; but if we do not identify
ourselves with it, we do not feel that misery. If a beautiful picture
belonging to another is burnt, a man does not generally become
miserable; but when his own picture is burnt, how miserable he
feels! Why? Both were beautiful pictures, perhaps copies of the
same original; but in one case very much more misery is felt than
in the other. It is because in one case he identifies himself with the
picture, and not in the other. This "I and mine" causes the whole
misery. With the sense of possession comes selfishness, and
selfishness brings on misery. Every act of selfishness or thought of
selfishness makes us attached to something, and immediately we
are made slaves. Each wave in the Chitta that says "I and mine"
immediately puts a chain round us and makes us slaves; and the
file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (71 of 88)2/25/2007 9:26:35 PM

Karma Yoga

more we say "I and mine", the more slavery grows, the more
misery increases. Therefore Karma-Yoga tells us to enjoy the
beauty of all the pictures in the world, but not to identify ourselves
with any of them. Never say "mine". Whenever we say a thing is
"mine", misery will immediately come. Do not even say "my
child" in your mind. Possess the child, but do not say "mine". If
you do, then will come the misery. Do not
say "my house," do not say "my body". The whole difficulty is
there. The body is neither yours, nor mine, nor anybody's. These
bodies are coming and going by the laws of nature, but we are
free, standing as witness. This body is no more free than a picture
or a wall. Why should we be attached so much to a body? If
somebody paints a picture, he does it and passes on. Do not
project that tentacle of selfishness, "I must possess it". As soon as
that is projected, misery will begin.
So Karma-Yoga says, first destroy the tendency to project this
tentacle of selfishness, and when you have the power of checking
it, hold it in and do not allow the mind to get into the ways of
selfishness. Then you may go out into the world and work as
much as you can. Mix everywhere, go where you please; you will
never be contaminated with evil. There is the lotus leaf in the
water; the water cannot touch and adhere to it; so will you be in
the world. This is called "Vairagya", dispassion or nonattachment. I believe I have told you that without non-attachment
there cannot be any kind of Yoga. Non-attachment is the basis of
all the Yogas. The man who gives up living in houses, wearing
fine clothes, and eating good food, and goes into the desert, may
be a most attached person. His only possession, his own body,
may become everything to him; and as he lives he will be simply
struggling for the sake of his body. Non-attachment does not mean
anything that we may do in relation to our external body, it is all
in the mind. The binding link of "I and mine" is in the mind. If we

Karma Yoga

have not this link with the body and with the things of the senses,
we are non-attached, wherever and whatever we may be. A man
may be on a throne and perfectly non-attached; another man may
be in rags and still very much attached. First, we have to attain this
state of non-attachment and then to work incessantly. KarmaYoga gives us the method that will help us in giving up all
attachment, though it is indeed very hard.
Here are the two ways of giving up all attachment. The one is for
those who do not believe in God, or in any outside help. They are
left to their own devices; they have simply to work with their own
will, with the powers of their mind and discrimination, saying, "I
must be non-attached". For those who believe in God there is
another way, which is much less difficult. They give up the fruits
of work unto the Lord; they work and are never attached to the
results. Whatever they see, feel, hear, or do, is for Him. For
whatever good work we may do, let us not claim any praise or
benefit. It is the Lord's; give up the fruits unto Him. Let us stand
aside and think that we are only servants obeying the Lord, our
Master, and that every impulse for action comes from Him every
moment. Whatever thou worshippest, whatever thou perceivest,
whatever thou doest, give up all unto Him and be at rest. Let us be
at peace, perfect peace, with ourselves, and give up our whole
body and mind and everything as an eternal sacrifice unto the
Lord. Instead of the sacrifice of pouring oblations into the fire,
perform this one great sacrifice day and night--the sacrifice of
your little self. "In search of wealth in this world, Thou art the
only wealth I have found; I sacrifice myself unto Thee. In search
of some one to be loved, Thou art the only one beloved I have
found; I sacrifice myself unto Thee." Let us repeat this day and
night, and say, "Nothing for me; no matter whether the thing is
good, bad, or indifferent; I do not care for it; I sacrifice all unto
Thee." Day and night let us renounce our seeming self until it
becomes a habit with us to do so, until it gets into the blood, the

nerves, and the brain, and the whole body is every moment
obedient to this idea of self-renunciation. Go then into the midst of
the battlefield, with the roaring cannon and the din of war, and
you will find yourself to be free and at peace.
Karma-Yoga teaches us that the ordinary idea of duty is on the
lower plane; nevertheless, all of us have to do our duty. Yet we
may see that this peculiar sense of duty is very often a great cause
of misery. Duty becomes a disease with us; it drags us ever
forward. It catches hold of us and makes our whole life miserable.
It is the bane of human life. This duty, this idea of duty is the
midday summer sun which scorches the innermost soul of
mankind. Look at those poor slaves to duty! Duty leaves them no
time to say prayers, no time to bathe. Duty is ever on them. They
go out and work. Duty is on them! They come home and think of
the work for the next day. Duty is on them! It is living a slave's
life, at last dropping down in the street and dying in harness, like a
horse. This is duty as it is understood. The only true duty is to be
unattached and to work as free beings, to give up all work unto
God. All our duties are His. Blessed are we that we are ordered
out here. We serve our time; whether we do it ill or well, who
knows? If we do it well, we do not get the fruits. If we do it ill,
neither do we get the care. Be at rest, be free, and work. This kind
of freedom is a very hard thing to attain. How easy it is to interpret
slavery as duty--the morbid attachment of flesh for flesh as duty!
Men go out into the world and struggle and fight for money or for
any other thing to which they get attached. Ask them why they do
it. They say, "It is a duty." It is the absurd greed for gold and gain,
and they try to cover it with a few flowers.
What is duty after all? It is really the impulsion of the flesh, of our
attachment; and when an attachment has become established, we
call it duty. For instance, in countries where there is no marriage,
there is no duty between husband and wife; when marriage comes,

husband and wife live together on account of attachment; and that
kind of living together becomes settled after generations; and
when it becomes so settled, it becomes a duty. It is, so to say, a
sort of chronic disease. When it is acute, we call it disease; when it
is chronic, we call it nature. It is a disease. So when attachment
becomes chronic, we baptise it with the high-sounding name of
duty. We strew flowers upon it, trumpets sound for it, sacred texts
are said over it, and then the whole world fights, and men
earnestly rob each other for this duty's sake. Duty is good to the
extent that it checks brutality. To the lowest kinds of men, who
cannot have any other ideal, it is of some good; but those who
want to be Karma Yogis must throw this idea of duty overboard.
There is no duty for you and me. Whatever you have to give to the
world, do give by all means, but not as a duty. Do not take any
thought of that. Be not compelled. Why should you be compelled?
Everything that you do under compulsion goes to build up
attachment. Why should you have any duty? Resign everything
unto God. In this tremendous fiery furnace where the fire of duty
scorches everybody, drink this cup of nectar and be happy. We are
all simply working out His will, and have nothing to do with
rewards and punishments. If you want the reward, you must also
have the punishment; the only way to get out of the punishment is
to give up the reward. The only way of getting out of misery is by
giving up the idea of happiness, because these two are linked to
each other. On one side there is happiness, on the other there is
misery. On one side there is life, on the other there is death. The
only way to get beyond death is to give up the love of life. Life
and death are the same thing, looked at from different points. So
the idea of happiness without misery, or of life without death, is
very good for school-boys and children; but the thinker sees that it
is all a contradiction in terms and gives up both. Seek no praise,
no reward, for anything you do. No sooner do we perform a good
action than we begin to desire credit for it. No sooner do we give
money to some charity than we want to see our names blazoned in

the papers. Misery must come as a result of such desires. The
greatest men in the world have passed away unknown. The
Buddhas and the Christs that we know are but second-rate heroes
in comparison with the greatest men of whom the world knows
nothing. Hundreds of these unknown heroes have lived in every
country working silently. Silently they live and silently they pass
away; and in time their thoughts find expression in Buddhas or
Christs, and it is these latter that become known to us. The highest
men do not seek to get any name or fame from their knowledge.
They leave their ideas to the world; they put forth no claims for
themselves and establish no schools or systems in their name.
Their whole nature shrinks from such a thing. They are the pure
Sattvikas, who can never make any stir, but only melt down in
love. I have seen one such Yogi who lives in a cave in India. He is
one of the most wonderful men I have ever seen. He has so
completely lost the sense of his own individuality that we may say
that the man in him is completely gone, leaving behind only the
all-comprehending sense of the divine. If an animal bites one of
his arms, he is ready to give it his other arm also, and say that it is
the Lord's will. Everything that comes to him is from the Lord. He
does not show himself to men, and yet he is a magazine of love
and of true and sweet ideas.
Next in order come the men with more Rajas, or activity,
combative natures, who take up the ideas of the perfect ones and
preach them to the world. The highest kind of men silently collect
true and noble ideas, and others--the Buddhas and Christs--go
from place to place preaching them and working for them. In the
life of Gautama Buddha we notice him constantly saying that he is
the twenty-fifth Buddha. The twenty-four before him are unknown
to history, although the Buddha known to history must have built
upon foundations laid by them. The highest men are calm, silent,
and unknown. They are the men who really know the power of
thought; they are sure that, even if they go into a cave and close

the door and simply think five true thoughts and then pass away,
these five thoughts of theirs will live through eternity. Indeed such
thoughts will penetrate through the mountains, cross the oceans,
and travel through the world. They will enter deep into human
hearts and brains and raise up men and women who will give them
practical expression in the workings of human life. These Sattvika
men are too near the Lord to be active and to fight, to be working,
struggling, preaching, and doing good, as they say, here on earth
to humanity. The active workers, however good, have still a little
remnant of ignorance left in them. When our nature has yet some
impurities left in it, then alone can we work. It is in the nature of
work to be impelled ordinarily by motive and by attachment. In
the presence of an ever active Providence who notes even the
sparrow's fall, how can man attach any importance to his own
work? Will it not be a blasphemy to do so when we know that He
is taking care of the minutest things in the world? We have only to
stand in awe and reverence before Him saying, "Thy will be
done". The highest men cannot work, for in them there is no
attachment. Those whose whole soul is gone into the Self, those
whose desires are confined in the Self, who have become ever
associated with the Self, for them there is no work. Such are
indeed the highest of mankind; but apart from them every one else
has to work. In so working we should never think that we can help
on even the least thing in this universe. We cannot. We only help
ourselves in this gymnasium of the world. This is the proper
attitude of work. If we work in this way, if we always remember
that our present opportunity to work thus is a privilege which has
been given to us, we shall never be attached to anything.
Millions like you and me think that we are great people in the
world; but we all die, and in five minutes the world forgets us. But
the life of God is infinite. "Who can live a moment, breathe a
moment, if this all-powerful One does not will it?" He is the ever
active Providence. All power is His and within His command.

Through His command the winds blow, the sun shines, the earth
lives, and death stalks upon the earth. He is the all in all; He is all
and in all. We can only worship Him. Give up all fruits of work;
do good for its own sake; then alone will come perfect nonattachment. The bonds of the heart will thus break, and we shall
reap perfect freedom. This freedom is indeed the goal of KarmaYoga.

CHAPTER 8
The ideal of Karma-Yoga
The grandest idea in the religion of the Vedanta is that we may
reach the same goal by different paths; and these paths I have
generalised into four, viz. those of work, love, psychology, and
knowledge. But you must, at the same time, remember that these
divisions are not very marked and quite exclusive of each other.
Each blends into the other. But according to the type which
prevails, we name the divisions. It is not that you can find men
who have no other faculty than that of work, nor that you can find
men who are no more than devoted worshippers only, nor that
there are men who have no more than mere knowledge. These
divisions are made in accordance with the type or the tendency
that may be seen to prevail in a man. We have found that, in the
end, all these four paths converge and become one. All religions
and all methods of work and worship lead us to one and the same
goal. I have already tried to point out that goal. It is freedom as I
understand it. Everything that we perceive around us is struggling
towards freedom, from the atom to the man, from the insentient,
lifeless particle of matter to the highest existence on earth, the
file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (78 of 88)2/25/2007 9:26:35 PM

Karma Yoga

human soul. The whole universe is in fact the result of this
struggle for freedom. In all combinations every particle is trying to
go on its own way, to fly from the other particles; but the others
are holding it in check. Our earth is trying to fly away from the
sun, and the moon from the earth. Everything has a tendency to
infinite dispersion. All that we see in the universe has for its basis
this one struggle towards freedom; it is under the impulse of this
tendency that the saint prays and the robber robs. When the line of
action taken is not a proper one, we call it evil; and when the
manifestation of it is proper and high, we call it good. But the
impulse is the same, the struggle towards freedom. The saint is
oppressed with the knowledge of his condition of bondage, and he
wants to get rid of it; so he worships God. The thief is oppressed
with the idea that he does not possess certain things, and he tries
to get rid of that want, to obtain freedom from it; so he steals.
Freedom is the one goal of all nature, sentient or insentient; and
consciously or unconsciously, everything is struggling towards
that goal. The freedom which the saint seeks is very different from
that which the robber seeks; the freedom loved by the saint leads
him to the enjoyment of infinite, unspeakable bliss, while that on
which the robber has set his heart only forges other bonds for his
soul.
There is to be found in every religion the manifestation of this
struggle towards freedom. It is the groundwork of all morality, of
unselfishness, which means getting rid of the idea that men are the
same as their little body. When we see a man doing good work,
helping others, it means that he cannot be confined within the
limited circle of "me and mine". There is no limit to this getting
out of selfishness. All the great systems of ethics preach absolute
unselfishness as the goal. Supposing this absolute unselfishness
can be reached by a man, what becomes of him? He is no more the
little Mr. So-and-so; he has acquired infinite expansion. The little
personality which he had before is now lost to him for ever; he has
file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (79 of 88)2/25/2007 9:26:35 PM

Karma Yoga

become infinite, and the attainment of this infinite expansion is
indeed the goal of all religions and of all moral and philosophical
teachings. The personalist, when he hears this idea philosophically
put, gets frightened. At the same time, if he preaches morality, he
after all teaches the very same idea himself. He puts no limit to the
unselfishness of man. Suppose a man becomes perfectly unselfish
under the personalistic system, how are we to distinguish him
from the perfected ones in other systems? He has become one with
the universe and to become that is the goal of all; only the poor
personalist has not the courage to follow out his own reasoning to
its right conclusion. Karma-Yoga is the attaining through unselfish
work of that freedom which is the goal of all human nature. Every
selfish action, therefore, retards our reaching the goal, and every
unselfish action takes us towards the goal; that is why the only
definition that can be given of morality is this: That which is
selfish is immoral, and that which is unselfish is moral.
But, if you come to details, the matter will not be seen to be quite
so simple. For instance, environment often makes the details
different as I have already mentioned. The same action under one
set of circumstances may be unselfish, and under another set quite
selfish. So we can give only a general definition, and leave the
details to be worked out by taking into consideration the
differences in time, place, and circumstances. In one country one
kind of conduct is considered moral, and in another the very same
is immoral, because the circumstances differ. The goal of all
nature is freedom, and freedom is to be attained only by perfect
unselfishness; every thought, word, or deed that is unselfish takes
us towards the goal, and, as such, is called moral. That definition,
you will find, holds good in every religion and every system of
ethics. In some systems of thought morality is derived from a
Superior Being--God. If you ask why a man ought to do this and
not that, their answer is : "Because such is the command of God."
But whatever be the source from which it is derived, their code of
file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (80 of 88)2/25/2007 9:26:35 PM

Karma Yoga

ethics also has the same central idea--not to think of self but to
give up self. And yet some persons, in spite of this high ethical
idea, are frightened at the thought of having to give up their little
personalities. We may ask the man who clings to the idea of little
personalities to consider the case of a person who has become
perfectly unselfish, who has no thought for himself, who does no
deed for himself, who speaks no word for himself, and then say
where his "himself" is. That "himself" is known to him only so
long as he thinks, acts, or speaks for himself. If he is only
conscious of others, of the universe, and of the all, where is his
"himself"? It is gone forever.
Karma-Yoga, therefore, is a system of ethics and religion intended
to attain freedom through unselfishness, and by good works. The
Karma-Yogi need not believe in any doctrine whatever. He may
not believe even in God, may not ask what his soul is, nor think of
any metaphysical speculation. He has got his own special aim of
realising selflessness; and he has to work it out himself. Every
moment of his life must be realisation, because he has to solve by
mere work, without the help of doctrine or theory, the very same
problem to which the Jnani applies his reason and inspiration and
the Bhakta his love.
Now comes the next question: What is this work? What is this
doing good to the world? Can we do good to the world? In an
absolute sense, no; in a relative sense, yes. No permanent or
everlasting good can be done to the world; if it could be done, the
world would not be this world. We may satisfy the hunger of a
man for five minutes, but he will be hungry again. Every pleasure
with which we supply a man may be seen to be momentary. No
one can permanently cure this ever-recurring fever of pleasure and
pain. Can any permanent happiness be given to the world? In the
ocean we cannot raise a wave without causing a hollow
somewhere else. The sum total of the good things in the world has
file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (81 of 88)2/25/2007 9:26:35 PM

Karma Yoga

been the same throughout in its relation to man's need and greed.
It cannot be increased or decreased. Take the history of the human
race as we know it today. Do we not find the same miseries and
the same happiness, the same pleasures and pains, the same
differences in position? Are not some rich, some poor, some high,
some low, some healthy, some unhealthy? All this was just the
same with the Egyptians, the Greeks, and the Romans in ancient
times as it is with the Americans today. So far as history is known,
it has always been the same; yet at the same time we find that,
running along with all these incurable differences of pleasure and
pain, there has ever been the struggle to alleviate them. Every
period of history has given birth to thousands of men and women
who have worked hard to smooth the passage of life for others.
And how far have they succeeded? We can only play at driving
the ball from one place to another. We take away pain from the
physical plane, and it goes to the mental one. It is like that picture
in Dante's hell where the misers were given a mass of gold to roll
up a hill. Every time they rolled it up a little, it again rolled down.
All our talks about the millennium are very nice as school-boys'
stories, but they are no better than that. All nations that dream of
the millennium also think that, of all peoples in the world, they
will have the best of it then for themselves. This is the
wonderfully unselfish idea of the millennium!
We cannot add happiness to this world; similarly, we cannot add
pain to it either. The sum total of the energies of pleasure and pain
displayed here on earth will be the same throughout. We just push
it from this side to the other side, and from that side to this, but it
will remain the same, because to remain so is its very nature. This
ebb and flow, this rising and falling, is in the world's very nature;
it would be as logical to hold otherwise as to say that we may have
life without death. This is complete nonsense, because the very
idea of life implies death and the very idea of pleasure implies
pain. The lamp is constantly burning out, and that is its life. If you

Karma Yoga

want to have life, you have to die every moment for it. Life and
death are only different expressions of the same thing looked at
from different standpoints; they are the falling and the rising of the
same wave, and the two form one whole. One looks at the "fall"
side and becomes a pessimist, another looks at the "rise" side and
becomes an optimist. When a boy is going to school and his father
and mother are taking care of him, everything seems blessed to
him; his wants are simple, he is a great optimist. But the old man,
with his varied experience, becomes calmer, and is sure to have
his warmth considerably cooled down. So, old nations, with signs
of decay all around them, are apt to be less hopeful than new
nations. There is a proverb in India: "A thousand years a city, and
a thousand years a forest." This change of city into forest and vice
versa is going on everywhere, and it makes people optimists or
pessimists according to the side they see of it.
The next idea we take up is the idea of equality. These millennium
ideas have been great motive powers to work. Many religions
preach this an an element in them--that God is coming to rule the
universe, and that then there will be no difference at all in
conditions. The people who preach this doctrine are mere fanatics,
and fanatics are indeed the sincerest of mankind. Christianity was
preached just on the basis of the fascination of this fanaticism, and
that is what made it so attractive to the Greek and the Roman
slaves. They believed that under the millennial religion there
would be no more slavery, that there would be plenty to eat and
drink; and, therefore, they flocked round the Christian standard.
Those who preached the idea first were of course ignorant
fanatics, but very sincere. In modern times this millennial
aspiration takes the form of equality--of liberty, equality, and
fraternity. This is also fanaticism. True equality has never been
and never can be on earth. How can we all be equal here? This
impossible kind of equality implies total death. What makes this
world what it is? Lost balance. In the primal state, which is called

Karma Yoga

chaos, there is perfect balance. How do all the formative forces of
the universe come then? By struggling, competition, conflict.
Suppose that all the particles of matter were held in equilibrium,
would there be then any process of creation? We know from
science that it is impossible. Disturb a sheet of water, and there
you find every particle of the water trying to become calm again,
one rushing against the other; and in the same way all the
phenomena which we call the universe--all things therein--are
struggling to get back to the state of perfect balance. Again a
disturbance comes, and again we have combination and creation.
Inequality is the very basis of creation. At the same time the forces
struggling to obtain equality are as much a necessity of creation as
those which destroy it.
Absolute equality, that which means a perfect balance of all the
struggling forces in all the planes, can never be in this world.
Before you attain that state, the world will have become quite
unfit for any kind of life, and no one will be there. We find,
therefore, that all these ideas of the millennium and of absolute
equality are not only impossible but also that, if we try to carry
them out, they will lead us surely enough to the day of destruction.
What makes the difference between man and man? It is largely the
difference in the brain. Nowadays no one but a lunatic will say
that we are all born with the same brain power. We come into the
world with unequal endowments; we come as greater men or as
lesser men, and there is no getting away from that pre-natally
determined condition. The American Indians were in this country
for thousands of years, and a few handfuls of your ancestors came
to their land. What difference they have caused in the appearance
of the country! Why did not the Indians make improvements and
build cities, if all were equal? With your ancestors a different sort
of brain power came into the land, different bundles of past
impressions came, and they worked out and manifested
themselves. Absolute non-differentiation is death. So long as this

Karma Yoga

world lasts, differentiation there will and must be, and the
millennium of perfect equality will come only when a cycle of
creation comes to its end. Before that, equality cannot be. Yet this
idea of realising the millennium is a great motive power. Just as
inequality is necessary for creation itself, so the struggle to limit it
is also necessary. If there were no struggle to become free and get
back to God, there would be no creation either. It is the difference
between these two forces that determines the nature of the motives
of men. There will always be these motives to work, some tending
towards bondage and others towards freedom.
This world's wheel within wheel is a terrible mechanism; if we put
our hands in it, as soon as we are caught we are gone. We all think
that when we have done a certain duty, we shall be at rest; but
before we have done a part of that duty, another is already in
waiting. We are all being dragged along by this mighty, complex
world-machine. There are only two ways out of it; one is to give
up all concerns with the machine, to let it go and stand aside, to
give up our desires. That is very easy to say, but is almost
impossible to do. I do not know whether in twenty millions of men
one can do that. The other way is to plunge into the world and
learn the secret of work, and that is the way of Karma-Yoga. Do
not fly away from the wheels of the world-machine, but stand
inside it and learn the secret of work. Through proper work done
inside, it is also possible to come out. Through this machinery
itself is the way out.
We have now seen what work is. It is a part of nature's foundation,
and goes on always. Those that believe in God understand this
better, because they know that God is not such an incapable being
as will need our help. Although this universe will go on always,
our goal is freedom, our goal is unselfishness; and according to
Karma-Yoga, that goal is to be reached through work. All ideas of
making the world perfectly happy may be good as motive powers
file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (85 of 88)2/25/2007 9:26:35 PM

Karma Yoga

for fanatics; but we must know that fanaticism brings forth as
much evil as good. The Karma Yogi asks why you require any
motive to work other than the inborn love of freedom. Be beyond
the common worldly motives. "To work you have the right, but
not to the fruits thereof." Man can train himself to know and to
practise that, says the Karma Yogi. When the idea of doing good
becomes a part of his very being, then he will not seek for any
motive outside. Let us do good because it is good to do good; he
who does good work even in order to get to heaven binds himself
down, says the Karma Yogi. Any work that is done with any the
least selfish motive, instead of making us free, forges one more
chain for our feet.
So the only way is to give up all the fruits of work, to be
unattached to them. Know that this world is not we, nor are we
this world; that we are really not the body; that we really do not
work. We are the Self, eternally at rest and at peace. Why should
we be bound by anything? It is very good to say that we should be
perfectly non-attached, but what is the way to do it? Every good
work we do without any ulterior motive, instead of forging a new
chain, will break one of the links in the existing chains. Every
good thought that we send to the world without thinking of any
return, will be stored up there and break one link in the chain, and
make us purer and purer, until we become the purest of mortals.
Yet all this may seem to be rather quixotic and too philosophical,
more theoretical than practical. I have read many arguments
against the Bhagavad-Gita, and many have said that without
motives you cannot work. They have never seen unselfish work
except under the influence of fanaticism, and, therefore, they
speak in that way.
Let me tell you in conclusion a few words about one man who
actually carried this teaching of Karma-Yoga into practice. That
man is Buddha. He is the one man who ever carried this into
file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (86 of 88)2/25/2007 9:26:35 PM

perfect practice. All the prophets of the world, except Buddha, had
external motives to move them to unselfish action. The prophets
of the world, with this single exception, may be divided into two
sets, one set holding that they are incarnations of God come down
on earth, and the other holding that they are only messengers from
God; and both draw their impetus for work from outside, expect
reward from outside, however highly spiritual may be the
language they use. But Buddha is the only prophet who said, "I do
not care to know your various theories about God. What is the use
of discussing all the subtle doctrines about the soul? Do good and
be good. And this will take you to freedom and to whatever truth
there is." He was, in the conduct of his life, absolutely without
personal motives; and what man worked more than he? Show me
in history one character who has soared so high above all. The
whole human race has produced but one such character, such high
philosophy, such wide sympathy. This great philosopher,
preaching the highest philosophy, yet had the deepest sympathy
for the lowest of animals, and never put forth any claims for
himself. He is the ideal Karma-Yogi, acting entirely without
motive, and the history of humanity shows him to have been the
greatest man ever born; beyond compare the greatest combination
of heart and brain that ever existed, the greatest soul-power that
has ever been manifested. He is the first great reformer the world
has seen. He was the first who dared to say, "Believe not because
some old manuscripts are produced, believe not because it is your
national belief, because you have been made to believe it from
your childhood; but reason it all out, and after you have analysed
it, then, if you find that it will do good to one and all, believe it,
live up to it, and help others to live up to it." He works best who
works without any motive, neither for money, nor for fame, nor
for anything else; and when a man can do that, he will be a
Buddha, and out of him will come the power to work in such a
manner as will transform the world. This man represents the very
highest ideal of Karma-Yoga.
